				<p class="x1bm-first" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="dropcap">I</span> got out of Las
					Encinas in the summer of ’08 and went home to be with my mom before she passed.
					I was not on drugs and got to spend a couple of wonderful months with her.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">My mom went over to the other side in July ’08. I
					was sadder than I’d ever been. And I left my body as I cried. I wailed, “Oh,
					God, how can my mommy die? God, oh, God, please, God.” I cried when Mom was
					lying there. And I hugged her and held her. We each got to sit with her. I got
					to sit with her after her soul left her body and talk to her and tell her things
					I had not told her. It felt as if she was still there with us as we spoke to
					her. I knew she could hear what I was saying. And felt as much there as she was
					before. We each said good-bye. Kissed her and wept.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">My mom, Susie, was somebody who wanted to make her
					own life. She was a real tomboy, which was hard in an age when women were
					supposed to get married, have children, stay at home, and be a housewife. Susie
					never was that, she wanted to go out into the world. She carried to the grave a
					regret that she hadn’t done something great with her life. But she had us, loved
					us, loved my dad.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-art-below" xml:lang="en-us">She painted, played the piano, made
					pottery, loved to finger paint with me, and read Rudyard Kipling’s <span
						class="italic">Just So Stories </span>to me when I was three. She was beyond
					talented. I could feel her living vicariously through me as I was growing
					up—from jumping out of trees .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to barefoot skiing .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
					to falling in love .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to screaming and arguing at the dinner table
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to screaming at a hundred thousand kids onstage. Toward the end
					she talked about a piece of her life that she felt was missing. But, ya see,
					that’s the piece that she gave to me. And no one can deny that I have lived a
					double life.</p>

				<p class="captions" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="caption-drop-cap">M</span>e and
					Mom, 1976. (Ron Pownall for Aerosmith)</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">When I was ten, my mom would say, “Yo, where are
					you going?” (Yes, Mom said “Yo!” She was ahead of her time.) And I could talk to
					her about anything. I tried to get her to smoke pot instead of cigarettes. It
					was her idea for me to be in music. “I’ll drive you to the gigs in the station
					wagon,” she said, and drove me and the Chain Reaction to the County Center in
					White Plains to open up for the Byrds.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I have this indelible image of my mom the way her
					brother, my uncle Eddie, described her as a young woman: jumping into a Buick
					convertible, her long hair streaming in the wind behind her—and <span
						class="italic">vroooooommmmm</span>! She was off in her element. She loved
					that. She was like a thoroughbred horse that just jumped the fence and was
					running free across the fields. With Susie it was always just, “Let’s go!”</p>
				<p class="x1bm-art-below" xml:lang="en-us">My mom passed away and so did my
					sobriety. I started using right after that. That went on for another half a
					year. I would spend nights at home thinking about going on tour with the band
					and I just couldn’t do it; I couldn’t dance. The pain was so excruciating just
					walking around and I had moments when I shed tears thinking, <span
						class="italic">I really can’t do this.</span></p>

					mother’s final resting place. (Steven Tallarico)</p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="sbdropcap">W</span>hile I
					was in Las Encinas in the spring of 2008, I got a call which pulled me out of my
					melancholy mood. Erin had just left and I was there all by myself doing
					Neurontin, a beta-blocker used to prevent seizures. Then on my twenty-sixth day
					there—which already felt like an eternity—Henry Smith of the Living Myth called
					me and said, “The Yardbirds are thinking of getting back together and they’re
					wondering if you might want to be the lead singer.” Well, hell, yeaaah! I would.
					I’d always had this dream that someday the old Yardbirds would re-form and I
					would somehow be part of it, and, damn me, if it wasn’t happening. The Yardbirds
					was the band that had been Aerosmith’s greatest inspiration, and, outside of
					Aerosmith, that would have been the group I would most want to be in.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Four months later I’m on the phone with Peter
					Mensch, Jimmy Page’s manager. “Peter, let me ask you something
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“You know I’d do anything for you, Steven,” he
					said. “Besides you gave me my first job.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“I did?”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“Don’t you remember, I was your tour accountant.
					Hah! Anyways, what was it you wanted to ask me?”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“I’d heard that Jimmy was thinking about re-forming
					the old Yardbirds and I—”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“Hold on, Steven, he’s right here,” and he handed
					Jimmy the phone.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“Steven,” said Jimmy, “would you consider coming
					over to the UK and giving it a try?”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“You know I’d really love to do that—it’s been a
					fantasy of mine since I was seventeen.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I wanted to do it because I wanted to say I did.
					Everybody’s dying to hear Led Zeppelin again, with me—or someone—especially
					Robert—singing lead. So, in September 2008, around the twenty-second as I
					recall, Henry, Erin, and I flew to London to see about doing some dates with
					Jimmy, John Paul Jones, and Jason Bonham, “Bonzo,” John Bonham’s son. Henry and
					I went to the studio in Putney and all went pretty well, I thought, but
					unfortunately I was getting high. The first day I was there I got a migraine.
					Friday we played Led Zep songs all day. Fuckin’ heaven!</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">But I soon realized it wasn’t going to work. Not
					that I couldn’t sing this stuff, I could do Led Zep in my sleep, but I wasn’t
					Robert Plant, and Robert wasn’t anything like me. Fans want to hear “Percy” wail
					on “Whole Lotta Love,” “Communication Breakdown,” etc. It never would have been
					the same. Aerosmith tried it when Joe and Brad left in the early eighties and it
					never worked without them either. I was flattered that he’d asked me, but it
					would be like trying to replace Bonzo—it’s not going to happen and maybe it
					shouldn’t. The way a band works is chemistry—and you can’t substitute for that.
					I blew it, but even though it didn’t work out, the kid in me was dying. I got to
					sing every song from “Black Dog” up and down. I called Jimmy and told him, “I’ll
					never forget the experience of singing with you as long as I live.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I just didn’t think a band like Led Zeppelin needed
					a singer like me. They already had the best; they were the best. Robert used to
					say, “I think I could sing and shear a few sheep at the same time.” I can think
					of a few things I could do while singing but that ain’t one of them. Maybe that
					was the problem.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Anyway, I was already missing my own band. I hadn’t
					given up yet. I’d been trying to get them to do an album for four years—and this
					detour made me more determined than ever.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">To tell the truth, one of the reasons I tried to do
					the thing with Jimmy Page was because I was feeling bereft. My mother had just
					died; Joe, my brother, was mad at me for working with other songwriters. I felt
					he was trying to get back at me by doing his own album. And then he disappeared
					off the face of the earth. I couldn’t find him under a rock and no one would
					tell me where he was. I called Truly Mean, who was our manager at the time. All
					she’d say is, “Joe’s unavailable.” Un-fucking-available!</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Then a few months later I heard my own band was
					trying to replace me, and I was like, what the fuck! They don’t get it. It’s all
					in the fucking mix. Robert’s banshee wail synchs with Jimmy’s plaintive Gibson
					EDS 1275 to make that high octane Led Zep sound. With us it’s the Screamin’
					Demon’s howl from hell and Joe’s raunchy blues grind that makes Aerosmith’s 150
					proof moonshine—pumped out by Brad, Joey, and Tom. It’s the collective vibe of
					four or five people tuned into each other that makes the bee sting and the honey
					drip. I knew what I had to do—gotta fly back to my hive, talk that jive, and hit
					the road again with that beautiful, dirty Aerosmith liquid hydrogen snarl that
					makes the liver quiver, the knees freeze, and the booty shake. And that’s an
					understatement!</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">But my feet were still writhing in pain. I could
					barely walk, and if I was to go out on tour I needed to prance. The band wanted
					to tour—and Aerosmith was my first love, a fucking gift from God—but I
					questioned whether I could even be onstage. The band said, “Aw, come on out,
					anyway, Steven, you can sit in a chair.” In a chair? In a fucking chair? Who did
					they think I was, Lightnin’ Hopkins? I’m a dancer. I can’t even sit still under
					normal conditions—so onstage, fuggedaboutit! I ground my teeth in anger at my
					brethren. You fucks, to discount my pain and think only about the money! So I
					was given the option: either I could sit in a chair and sing (yeah, right!) or
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. guess what?</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">In the spring of ’09 I went to see Dr. Brian McKeon
					again. He’s going to know how to take care of my problem, I figured. He treats
					athletes, and they’re all crippled at forty, all on some kind of painkiller. He
					did prescribe something really effective, something that attacked the higher
					centers of pain, so I could at least get onstage without being plunged into the
					hell of screaming skulls.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Effectively medicated, I went on the Aerosmith-ZZ
					Top tour (the so-called A to Z Tour), which began in Maryland Heights, Missouri,
					on June 10, 2009. It wasn’t long before I began abusing my meds. On the list of
					side effects—sleeplessness, nausea, sweating, headaches—they should add: “may
					cause patient to respond in an inappropriate manner to the horseshit of others.”
					I wanted to explain to the band why I was on drugs. It wasn’t—as many cynically
					believed, “Oh, that’s Steven” wanting to get high. It was me trying to get
					through the pain. And I fell hard because it was hard. I sacrificed my sobriety
					and my sanity! And I did it all for them! Sob!</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">The tour was going fine. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I was
					planning to work on my book—the very thing you hold in your hands!—but Dave
					Dalton was sending me huge chunks of manuscript and I was having a hard time
					reading that many pages. I told him, “Only send me twenty pages at a time.” But
					did he? Not that it would have made that much difference because—on serious
					doses of Lune-fucking-esta and the Suboxone—I was in the way-out-a-sphere and
					not really up to reading twenty fortune cookies, never mind twenty pages of
					Steven-fucking-ography. It’s not that easy to revisit your checkered past while
					snorting long lines of Lunesta—which I was spending too much time in my room
					doing.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">It’s funny. After all the drugs that I ever did,
					all the coke and the rest of it, now I am on Lunesta? Lunesta! The least of the
					sleeping meds. But I just needed to do it. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I was flying on the
					wings of Lunesta, and that along with the Suboxone that I was taking, supposedly
					one of, but by now I was up to two or three. Suboxone is used to treat opiate
					addiction—but it has a morphine derivative in it, so. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But never
					the day of the show!</p>
				<p class="x1bm-art-below" xml:lang="en-us">August 5, 2009, Sturgis, South Dakota,
					the Sturgis motorcycle rally. It’s a big day because my brother-in-law, Mark
					DeRico, and I were building our Red Wing motorcycles, and Red Wing was going to
					be named bike of the year there. Sturgis is biker heaven and I was getting
					nicely loaded. I was there with my friend Justin Murdoch. Justin’s downstairs
					with me and Erin, and Mark and the family were upstairs in the hotel. The night
					comes, we play the gig, I fall off the stage and suddenly everybody is on a
					witch hunt for Justin. They just assumed he was the one who had given me the
					drugs. Now Justin’s like my father—he can’t drink more than one beer, two beers
					tops. No one gave me any drugs! I was using—if you can call it that—doing the
					Lunesta! And instead of eating the three pills prescribed me I was snorting
					them, too, at night. That’s all! Compared to what anyone who went to see Hendrix
					swallowed, or smoked at a Be-in or Woodstock .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Lunesta? What the
					fuck! That’s like .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. smoking banana peels! After all my running in
					the seventies, eighties, and nineties, I’m smoking banana peels? You know ain’t
					nothing in that. It’s like what the fuck?</p>

				<p class="captions" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="caption-drop-cap">A</span> gift

					(Ross Halfin)</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Here’s what happened that night moment-by-moment in
					Tylerama: The night of the show, we’re backstage, we’re waiting to go on.
					There’s a terrible thunderstorm. Lightning puts out the electricity on half the
					stage and the floor is flooded, soaking wet. They’re trying to mop up the stage
					and consequently the show is held back an hour. A fucking hour! Anyway, we get
					out there and we get to “Love in an Elevator.” Suddenly the sound goes out, my
					microphone is dead. I walk back to Joey and go, “Can you hear?” No response. So
					I make a T sign for time-out and he runs his finger across his neck like he is
					slitting his throat, signaling, “No, I can’t.” I begin walking slowly back down
					to the front of the stage to start singing “Love in an Elevator,” but half the
					PA system is out in the front of the house and just to keep the audience
					entertained I do one of my Tyler moves—and I fall off the side of the stage. I
					zigged when I should have zagged, and I fell eight feet ten inches. Right then
					and there I knew the world was gonna know I fell off the stage and what they
					were going to think. And there it was, the whole thing on YouTube as soon as I
					got to the hospital, twenty minutes later. I just figured, What the fuck? I’ll
					say, “Yep, I was high,” and just call a spade a spade. Tyler falls off stage.
					Tyler fucked-up on drugs. I could’ve sidestepped the whole thing by saying, “I
					zigged when I should have zagged.” </p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Backstage they laid me out in my dressing room on a
					gurney and only Brad Whitford came back to see how I was. Only guy in the band.
					When I fell off the stage, a soon-to-be band member’s wife yelled at my manager,
					“You know what happens when you let him hang out with drug addicts?” So, after
					falling off the stage everyone got so mad at me no one in the band called me for
					twenty-seven weeks. I’m not sure how deep I would want to go with this, but it’s
					just fucking ironic, isn’t it, that not one of those fucks came to see what was
					going on with me, and when I asked them a couple of months ago, “What the fuck?”
					they said, “Well, we were angry at you!” Angry? They were angry at me for
					falling off the stage? That was the best that they could come up with.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">After falling off the stage, I started the healing
					process and twelve weeks later I went out on the road to do a few makeup gigs
					with the band—San Francisco, Honolulu, Maui—or we’d have been sued. I did them,
					but I still wasn’t talking to the band. I had my manager get me a Winnebago so
					that I wouldn’t have to go backstage and see any of them. Not once did I talk to
					any one of those pricks. I got out onstage that first night in San Francisco but
					not one word did I speak. I shot daggers at them, smiled, put my arm around Joe,
					thinking, You fuck! I remember looking at Joey—he and I had always had a laugh
					together—but I just stared him down. I read a book by Og Mandino called <span
						class="italic">The Greatest Salesman in the World,</span> where it says if
					you tell yourself when you’re angry at your friend, that you love him, he’ll
					feel it. It works. But at that moment I looked at Joey and said silently to
					myself, “I hate you, you fucking piece of shit.” I didn’t know what else to do.
					And .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it was one of the best shows we’ve ever done.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I got chastised for falling off the stage high.
					That I may have done. I guess some are yet to fall off their own stage. I see
					people in this band who drink and fuck up, fuck up and drink, and if I ever
					point that out to them they always say, “Yeah, but I didn’t do what you did.”
					The hypocritical finger-pointing shit. “I don’t have a problem.” Yet. And then,
					lo and behold, what do I see not so long ago but one of the guys in the band
					mid-snorting, there was a fucking luger at the end of his nose. I saw the
					picture! It was taken by a Fan Club Girl, Amanda Eyre, of a certain member of
					the band with a fucking stalactite hanging out of his nose. It was a high def
					image so we zoomed in to see what the fuck color it was so we could figure out
					what drug he was snorting.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">When those gigs were over, I went to New York, got
					an apartment on the Upper West Side, and worked with Keren Pinkas who was
					helping me organize my book. During this time the band was scouting for other
					lead singers behind my back and putting out rumors that I was leaving
					Aerosmith—that I had quit. On November 10, 2009, I was at dinner with Erin
					Brady, Mark Hudson, Mark’s girlfriend, and Keren Pinkas in New York and there
					was a phone call from Paul Santo, Joe Perry’s guitar player, saying, “Hey, we’re
					playing down here at Irving Plaza, blah, blah, blah. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” And I
					thought, hold on a minute, let’s go get a limousine, we’ll ride downtown to the
					theater and wait outside until he’s about to do his encore, then I’ll run in and
					get up onstage and tell the world what happened.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">We orchestrated it like a movie where you go in,
					you go out, and no one gets hurt, like the scene from <span class="italic">Oh,
						Brother Where Art Thou?</span> I was going to go in and fucking take over.
					We put our plan into action. We called the limousine company. I said, “Keren,
					look up on the Internet, find out what Joe played at his last show, and then
					we’ll know exactly what song he does before he comes back and does his encore:
					“Walk This Way.” Then we sent Keren into the theater as our satellite, as our
					mole. Keren went and stood right in front of Joe. Right away, she texts me, “Oh
					my god, I can’t believe it, there’s barely two hundred to three hundred people
					here. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It’s half empty.” Poor Joe’s in there playing to half an
					audience! Then Keren texts me again, “I think this is his last song.” We run in,
					I meet the guys at the back door, and they recognize me. I tell them, “I gotta
					get onstage right now!” They go, “Okay, okay, okay, Mr. Tyler!” We’re like a
					snake, running through the crowd, this way and that. I see Billie Perry, she
					sees me and goes, “Joe! Joe! Steven’s here!” She starts freaking. It’s Elyssa
					Perry, the Wicked Witch of the North again. Billie, Elyssa, same woman. If you
					ever meet guys who have had three, four wives, you know they keep getting
					married to the same woman over and over. They pick a new woman who’s just like
					the old one every time. Nothing else will do. If you’re a sex addict, you’re not
					gonna go look for a date in a library!</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">So I go backstage, Joe’s just come off, and I walk
					in the room and go, “Hey, Joe, what’s going on?” He goes, “Nothin.” I say,
					“Havin’ a rough night?” He doesn’t answer me. I say, “Joe, let’s go up there, I
					want to do ‘Walk This Way’ with you.” He introduces me to his lead singer, some
					German kid named Hagen Grohe. I say, “I know I heard you up there. How you
					doin?” and shake his hand. Joe says, “Here’s what’s going to happen. My guy
					Hagen’s gonna take a verse then you take a verse.” And I go, “Well, now you know
					that just ain’t gonna happen!!” I shoulda said, “FUCK YOU I’m singing it. What
					are you gonna do about it?” Just like when I was growing up, the guys in the
					gangs, that’s what they did. “Fuck you, I’m stealing your date, what are you
					gonna do about it, prick?” That was the kind of words that went down in Yonkers
					among the Green Mountain Boys. But instead what I said was, “Come on, Joe, let’s
					go, let’s go do this thing.” There was tension and an ominous silence that you
					could cut with a knife. It was bullshit. I said, “Joe, come on, man, they’re
					waiting for you.” I walked out and he had to follow me. I grabbed the mic and
					the place was roaring. They gave us a standing ovation for at least a
					minute—that’s a long fucking time when you’re up there—it seemed like two
					minutes of whistling, clapping, and hollering. I got them to quiet down. I said,
					“All right, here’s what’s happening. I’m going to sing with Joe tonight. The
					rumors about me quitting the band aren’t true. And Joe, you’re a man that wears
					a coat of many colors. But I, motherfucker, am the rainbow.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I thought, where the fuck did I get that from? You
					get these moments when you know how the movie’s going to go. I said, “Count it
					off, drummer boy!” And we did the song and when it was done I jumped off the
					stage, into the crowd, went out into the limousine and went, “Uh, what just
					happened?”</p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="sbdropcap"
					>E</span>ventually I moved into my daughter Liv’s brownstone in the Village—she
					was off doing a movie. During Thanksgiving I drank, did some blow again, and
					then Christmas was coming up so I had a guy bring me an eight ball of coke and a
					bunch of pills. And those deliveries got through Erin a couple times. But by
					December, the last package arrived and Erin saw it and said, “What is this?” I
					said, “Gimme that!” I pulled it away from her and the package ripped. Cocaine
					went all over the place. I went back later that night and snorted it all up, off
					the counters and everywhere, and got a nice fucking rail out of it. It was
					pretty cool. It’s interesting how fast you can go back to romancing your drug. I
					got laid the first time on coke. I’ve done every fucking drug under the sun.
					I’ve smoked combs, for chrissakes! You’d buy a nickel plastic comb in the men’s
					room at a gas station, cut all the teeth off, stick one in the end of a
					cigarette, and smoke the plastic. Pure poison. But, like they used to say in the
					Renaissance, <span class="italic">Dosis sola facit venenum,</span> which
					translates to something like, “Only the quantity makes the poison.” A very cool
					saying by Paracelsus, a sixteenth-century alchemist and doctor: “All things are
					poisons,” he said, “for there is nothing without poisonous qualities.
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It is only the dose which makes a thing poison.” I love it.
					Anyway, <span class="italic">amo, amas, amat,</span> and December 14 rolls
					around, and I’m laying in bed, wiped out from arguing all day with Dave Dalton.
					I’ve been having a shitty week, which got a whole lot worse after Erin found my
					shit. Four <span class="sc">A.M.</span> she wakes me up and says, “Guess where
					you’re going? Betty Ford.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I called my friend Frank Angie who sent his plane
					for me. The guy loves me—he’ll do anything for me. We flew out to L.A., then
					flew over to Palm Springs where I made a brief pit stop to grab a double double
					In and Out burger—where they bake the fries in the bun—for my last meal in
					civilian life.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Oh, you know what I forgot to say? We have to put
					it in right here. Just before that tour where I fell off the stage, I was in New
					York. I was up here on the West Side and went to this little restaurant where I
					met my new manager Allen Kovac, who I’d met through his partner at 10th Street
					Entertainment, Eric Sherman. I told him about my problems and what was going on
					with the band.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-art-below" xml:lang="en-us">The day before I went to Betty Ford, I
					said to Allen, “Get me something else, something besides the band. I need to
					have some backup plan outside of Aerosmith.” My father used to tell me: “Always
					have a backup plan, something you can fall back on.” Aerosmith wasn’t exactly a
					sure thing anymore; they were looking around for other lead singers—and I was
					getting calls from Lenny Kravitz .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. who was wondering if I was
					really quitting the band.</p>

				<p class="captions" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="caption-drop-cap">M</span>y last
					drink, 2009. Go big or go home. (Erin Brady)</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I knew I was going to be all right after the second
					day at Betty Ford. I went from detox to the community, having, ironically
					enough, come to Betty Ford high on the very same drug they wound up giving me to
					deal with my addiction: Suboxone. They let me out in a day, only to be greeted
					by this guy who said, “Hi, I’m the Kings of Leon’s dad.” His kids didn’t like
					the way their dad was behaving. He’d remarried and they hated his new wife, he
					was getting drunk all the time, running trucks and buses off the road (he was
					the band’s tour manager)—just fucked-up shit. So they sent him to rehab, and so
					I spent the next month in the best of company with the Kings of Leon’s dad.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">After detoxing and spending a month at Betty Ford,
					I was talked into spending two more months there. After the first month at Betty
					Ford they put you in what’s called the lane. It’s a house in a cul-de-sac. I
					lived there with four other guys—three rooms, two guys in each bedroom. The
					first day I was there I went, “Wait a minute, you guys are doctors?” “Yup.” One
					was shooting fentonyl, a potent narcotic painkiller, and the other was
					delivering babies and stealing all the drugs he could get his hands on. They all
					had to submit to random urine tests—or they’d never get their licenses back.
					There was a pilot there who flew a route from England to America. On the day of
					the flight he was dead drunk and fell out of the truck taking him to the plane
					he was about to fly. His best friend, thank God, grabbed him and sent him into
					rehab. Can you imagine what would have happened if he’d taken off and flown the
					plane bombed out of his mind? That’s who I was in rehab with. I decided I’m just
					going to do it, too—the random urines and whatever. I don’t give a fuck. At this
					stage of the game, you’re kind of a little like I will follow the program
					wherever it takes me, I will do whatever it is to get through this.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I knew that after the first month in rehab that my
					not calling anybody in the band was really fucked up. It was one thing for those
					suck-asses to not call me for twenty-seven weeks; it was quite another thing
					when I didn’t call them, because when you’re in rehab, you look at your own side
					of the street. It was then that I realized that I loved the band, regardless of
					a guitar player that’s a loose canon and doing a solo record and angry at me for
					doing stuff he’d done half a dozen times himself. And suddenly I’m Peck’s Bad
					Boy? There’s the pot calling the kettle beige.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">After I’d been there two months I was told I could
					go home for a week, which I did. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I had a meeting with the band,
					at which time I begged their forgiveness and sincerely apologized for my
					behavior. Looking around the room I realized that although we had all allegedly
					gotten sober in the late eighties, some of us didn’t exactly stay with the
					program. Some of us never did get sober. I did, Joey followed .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
					but not everybody cleaned up and that’s the sad truth. Naturally I’m always the
					identified patient. If you get Steven sober, then you’ll have a band. You need
					the lead singer, you can’t lose him! I begged their dodgy forgiveness and said,
					“Let’s go out on tour when I get out of Betty Ford.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">When I got out of rehab, that day on the fifteenth
					of March, there was a song that needed to be written for a million dollars. The
					next day and the day after that I’m writing that song with Marti Frederiksen and
					Kara DioGuardi who was the judge from <span class="italic">American Idol</span>.
					We came up with a great song called “Love Lives” for a Japanese movie called
						<span class="italic">Space Battleship Yamato</span>.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Then we’re on tour again. After a month of
					rehearsing, we hit Caracas, Venezuela, May 18, 2010. “Caracas of Your Assus” was
					the running joke. And it was one of the best tours we’d ever done. It was a bit
					ironic and a thorn in my side, but not worth getting angry over after spending
					three months in rehab, that I came back to a band where someone was still using.
					I don’t give a fuck. I live for this band, but the world needs to know.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">South America, Europe, the United States.
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Where are we going to go with this? Oh yeah, Caracas of Your
					Assus .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Some of the districts there were beyond the Third World,
					they were more like the Fourth World. They were selling incense and papaya,
					goat’s heads, sugar skulls, and monkey meat .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. anything you can
					imagine. While I was there I went downtown to the area where they used to
					torture people, looking for an AA meeting—my own personal inquisition. Where is
					it? <span class="italic">¿Donde es?</span> Oh, it’s up there. You climb up the
					spiral steps of this building in the middle of downtown. It was the old hellhole
					jail .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and you walk into the interrogation room—that will sober
					you right up fast—that’s where all the bad shit happened .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and
					it’s an AA meeting. Two fucking hours. Drinking nothing but black coffee with
					tons of sugar in it in these little plastic cups. Not one word did I understand,
					but I picked up on their passion. They were doing Caracas drugs: opium, heroin,
					drinking. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">When we go on tour to a new place, I like to get to
					each gig two nights ahead of the band ’cause I like to walk around, get a feel
					for the town, and get a good night’s rest before the first show. I brought a
					sober companion with me, Chappy, one of the stars on <span class="italic"
						>Brotherhood</span>—very funny guy at the beginning of the series with a
					huge cock, I mean clock .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. dock.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-art-below" xml:lang="en-us">The J. Geils Band tried to throw their
					lead singer, Peter Wolf, out, too. I had had a nice long talk with him. I said,
					“These fucking guys, they’re trying to find a new lead singer because I’m in
					rehab, can you believe that? While I’m down on my knees, at my lowest ebb, what
					do I find? My old band of brothers is auditioning lead singers to replace me
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as if that were even possible! Forty fucking years of brotherly
					love, knockdown fights and drug hoarding .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. did that mean nothing
					to them? And now they want to replace me .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and all because I fell
					off a stage. The exact same thing Joe Perry’s done five times before I did it.
					Wait, wait, wait! I need a witness, can I get a witness? Isn’t that why they
					called us the Toxic Twins, because of .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ?” Peter Wolf looked at me
					like Mr. Natural saying, “What else is new?”</p>

				<p class="captions" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="caption-drop-cap">J</span>ohnny B.
					(Joe’s guy and road manager extraordinaire) and me, London, 2010. (Ross Halfin
					for Aerosmith)</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">June 29, 2010. We were on tour in France, when Kara
					DioGuardi texted me asking if I’ve ever thought about being a judge on <span
						class="italic">American Idol,</span> because apparently she didn’t want to
					continue doing it. I didn’t know. Like a dummy, I went, “Does it still have high
					ratings?” She’s going, “Oh, yeah!” So I said, “Well, I’ll get back to you.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Early July I’m on a plane coming back from England
					to start the American leg of the tour and there’s an in-flight movie called the
						<span class="italic">Back-up Plan</span> playing. There’d already been
					rumors and grumblings about my doing <span class="italic">American Idol</span>.
					My own internal interrogator is going, “Can you do it, Steven? Do you want to do
					it, lad?” I said, “You know, yeah, I do.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Three weeks later, we’re getting ready to begin the
					American tour down in Florida. And that’s when I said, “You know, I’m just gonna
					fucking do it.” And I signed the papers. I hadn’t told the band yet.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">When we get to Vegas, Joe barges into my dressing
					room and accosts me: “What the fuck’s going on?” And I, all innocent, said,
					“What?” “Well, how come I’m finding out about this in the press? Why didn’t you
					tell me?” And I say, “Well, c’mon man, two months ago you were trying to throw
					me out of the band, so I got myself a job, that way I’ve got something steady
					while you guys are trying to figure out what you want to do.” It’s all water
					under the bridge now. It’s all this bullshit that happens because bands’ wives
					get to talking to the guys in the band. When we’re onstage, none of that shit’s
					there. But when they’re off the road, their wives start pecking them to
					death.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">The day I came out of rehab is the day the rest of
					the band should have gone in. Nevertheless, the tour was beyond successful and
					we end up August 15, 2010, at Fenway Park on a double bill blowout with J.
					Geils—twin bad boys from Boston—selling out the stadium. The last show on the
					tour was September 16 in Vancouver, and then .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Next stop: <span class="italic">American
						Idol</span>. Hey, like my dad said, make sure you have something to fall
					back on in case your day job doesn’t pan out. And, boy, what a day job I
					got!</p>
