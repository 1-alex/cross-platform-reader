					sometimes I feel like that young kid, this seventeen-year-old who just wormholed
					himself into this sixty-year-old man. The voice seems fine, but then there’s my
					feet, my knee, and my throat. But when I hit the stage, something miraculous
					happens. I go on tour and after a month I turn into Peter-fucking-Pan. The band
					is my happy thought and then I get my wings again. It’s my fountain of youth. I
					get so strong from the workout that I’m zapped back into being a
					twenty-year-old. And it’s not that I <span class="italic">feel</span> that way,
					but it <span class="italic">is</span> that I <span class="italic">am</span> that
					way.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Janis, Jimi, Jim Morrison, Keats, and Brian Jones,
					didn’t they all die at twenty-six or twenty-seven? It’s that weird doomed age.
					And I always wondered, since we all shared the same lifestyle, would I live past
					that glorious age. And guess what? I’ve been lucky; I’ve lived long past that. I
					was born on March 26, so I always wondered what I’d look like when I was
					twenty-six. It’s funny, when I was a teenager and way before Aerosmith, I would
					dry my hair after a shower with a blow-dryer and search for my face in the foggy
					mirror—because I couldn’t see my reflection. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I aimed the dryer
					at the clouded glass. There I was at ninety, and then the slow melt back to
					nineteen .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. “Every time that I look in the mirror .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”
					Gee .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. sounds familiar! But the singer didn’t arrive until the song
					was written. Life is like a roll of toilet paper, the closer it gets to the end,
					the faster it goes.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Erin and I were sitting on the lawn in Sunapee, New
					Hampshire, one morning and the phone rang. It was Billy Joel. He asked me if I’d
					like to play the final show that Shea Stadium would ever see. I told him I saw
					the Beatles there in 1965 and that I’d love to do it. He sent a plane for us and
					we were on our way. Jump to .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I’m backstage in my dressing room
					when Billy Joel walks in, saying his hellos. He introduces me to Tony Bennett,
					who to me is a god .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. second only to Frank Sinatra. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
					and I’m sharing a dressing room with him. HUDDA THUNK? Tony then introduces me
					to his son who asks me, “Do you know whose jacket this is?” It’s in my dressing
					room so I’m thinking, it gotta be mine, but no, I tell him, “It reeks of Sgt
					Pepper.” At which time he says, “Yeah, and it’s Ringo’s .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” And he
					lets me try it on. Turns out, he’s one of the largest collectors of Beatles
					memorabilia in the history of memory. So, here I am, sixty days sober, sixty
					years old, sixty thousand people in the audience and in the house.
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Sir Paul fucking McCartney, as the extra special guest, flown in
					from London that evening, who’s closing the show with “I Saw Her Standing
					There.” Forty-three years since I heard the Beatles open up with that at the
					same stadium back in 1965. We flew back to Sunapee that night and sitting out on
					the lawn in the dark, the same lawn where we had been that morning, I asked
					myself, “What just happened, what did I just do?” Living on the tail of a comet,
					it’s all so fast. It’s such an age of supersonic travel, transcendental or
					otherwise, and instant everything that life can become a blur for me.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">When we tour we often hub in Minneapolis, fly to
					Detroit after that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and two hours later we’re back in the same
					hotel, hitting the sheets by four and thinking, “Where were we tonight?” When
					you rattle it back and forth .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. memories of what <span
						class="italic">that</span> tour was like, it all blends together: plane,
					limo, lobby, backstage, encore, limo, lobby, dressing room, plane. It’s just a
					big fucking <span class="italic">blurrrrr</span>.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Sometimes it feels like .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. all I’m
					doing is rearranging deck chairs on the fucking <span class="italic"
						>Titanic</span>. And then I wonder why I don’t dream anymore—my subconscious
					must be saturated.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-art-below" xml:lang="en-us">What I’ve seen, faces that remind me of
					faces, places that remind of other places I’ve never even been to yet
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It’s just another example of vooja de. I could talk to you
					forever about the people I’ve met in the shadows of time, in the vibrations
					between musical fifths, even in the spaces between the words you’re reading
					right now. But when I zero in, things come into focus. When I went back and
					looked at my yearbook, seems like everybody I ever knew was there in those
					twenty small pages. Different people maybe, but then one tends to morph into
					another. Those forty or fifty kids in your graduating class, you never thought
					their faces would bleed into the future. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And so now I realize
					after peering into my own yearbook that the guy who was sitting next to me in
					wood shop looks exactly like the president of Sony. Where am I going with this?
					Whatever happened to a good melody? Maybe to be the headline speaker at the
					Alzheimer’s convention with speech in hand .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to an empty house
					that forgot how to get there. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Gasp! Only to wake up in front of
					President Obama, Oprah, and Paul McCartney singing the last four songs of “Abbey
					Road” at the 2010 Kennedy Awards. And you tell me I’m not living the dream.</p>

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">One day, after my mom had passed, my dad sent me an
					e-mail which said: “Don’t wait until it’s the last minute to make the phone
					call. And use one of the quarters I gave you for these calls as a kid.” So I
					wrote him this little poem:</p>

					and two years later my man child, Taj, was born. Fatherhood changed me forever.
					I wept when I heard Chelsea sing in kindergarten. I burst with pride when Taj
					graduated high school. My heart broke from the honesty that Mia put in her book.
					And how Liv dazzles me in her movies. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And now I’m ever so

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Some of the marriages weren’t so happy for
					everyone, but most of the times we had were great. There wasn’t a woman that I
					had a child with that I didn’t love, but there were always two trains running:
					my family, my band. Sometimes toward each other and other times away. And a lot
					of the women in my life couldn’t understand that. Seems like the light at the
					end of the tunnel may be you. You write a song with somebody, and it’s like
					having a child with them. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The songs are my spirit children.
					You’re evoking the spirits, conjuring up moments in time, ephemeral seconds
					where you hear that O YEAH sound in your head and catch the scat on the wing. Or
					it’s gone.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I now live in Laurel Canyon. I can’t believe I live
					where all my idols once lived, the very houses I’d drive by and wonder what
					fantastic scenes were going down in there. Jim Morrison lived one house down
					from me, Mama Cass three doors away, Chris Hilman of the Byrds two houses away
					from her, Frank Zappa and the GTO’s, Joni Mitchell and Carole King lived across
					the street from the guys in Buffalo Springfield, John Mayall, the magus of the
					Bluesbreakers lived there briefly, as did Jimi Hendrix in Errol Flynn’s old
					house.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-art-below" xml:lang="en-us">It’s hard to tell who I am by the trail
					left by my musical career. I am the Demon of Screamin’, the dude that looks like
					a lady, the rag doll that married Lucy in the Sky. But I’m also something more
					than the rock ’n’ roll junky whore who got his foot inside the door. Sure, we’re
					the sum of our experiences. If you listen to that song I wrote in 1969, “Dream
					On,” you might get a different view. I may not have been quite sure of what I
					was doing, but I was on to something. Just sayin’. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
