				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Now the blues is, was, and always has been the

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“Once upon a time .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” “In the
					beginning was .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” That’s the way it always starts off. Every story,
					gospel, history, chronicle, myth, legend, folktale, or old wives’ tale blues
					riff begins with “Woke up this mornin’. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” The blues is soiled
					with muddy water, funky with Storyville whorehouse sweat and jizz, smoky from
					juke-joint canned heat, stained with hundred-proof rotgut and cheap cologne.
					It’s so potent ’cause it’s been in every low-down, get-down joint the world has
					ever seen.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Everybody sucks on someone’s tit, and ours was the
					bitch’s brew of the blues.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="sbdropcap">M</span>y first
					sexual musical epiphanies came through the radio. They were all entangled
					together. I can’t remember how old I was when I first realized they were
					separate things—but <span class="italic">are</span> they? That’s the question. I
					used to listen to the radio as if these sounds and voices were coming from outer
					space. Deejays were magicians who talked to you through the air somehow and
					brought you these erotic sounds, songs about love, desire, jealousy, loss, and
					sex. Later on I’d listen to 1010 <span class="caps">WINS</span>, which was a New
					York rock station back then, and hear all these great crazy characters talking
					that buzzy deejay jive talk.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">When I moved with the band at the end of 1970 to
					Boston, it had the greatest rock ’n’ roll stations of all time, and believe me I
					heard them all. Radio at its finest.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">When Aerosmith was just starting out I began dating
					a very sexy deejay at one of those stations. I’d never known an actual disc
					jockey before, but I knew they were famous people who could get you famous—and
					thus get you laid. But until I met her I didn’t know you could do both
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. on the air.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Of course me being in a band and trying to make it
					in Boston, what better thing than to be over there on the air making out with
					her while she was doing the dog and cat reports—that’s when they announced the
					missing pups and pussies. She didn’t have prime-time spotage so she had to do a
					lot of public service spots: the community center is having a dance; the local
					synagogue is throwing a picnic.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">It was hilarious the things I did to that woman
					while we were on the air just to see if I could rattle her cage. I never really
					did. It was funny, though; we did the most incredible things. I’d give her head
					while she was on the air, take off her panties and have her sit on my lap and
					fuck her.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Such outrageous stuff, and we got away with it!
					Nobody knew, but let me tell you what .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. she got rave reviews! Not
					only were we getting very, very high—I was shoveling spoonfuls of coke under her
					nose—but we were really climbing under the covers, so to speak. All this while
					she’s playing Led Zeppelin, Yardbirds, Animals, Guess Who, Montrose, Stones—tons
					of great shit. It was a graveyard shift, but regardless of what it was, big or
					small, we were still live on the air, and it makes you just want to test the
					water and see what you can get away with. I used to do shit like sing along with
					records—people didn’t know that I was doing it, they must have thought she was
					playing some outtake or live track. I’d tell jokes, recite limericks, make up
					bizarre news items. God, that was heaven!</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I would be all over the place: early Fleetwood Mac
					with Peter Green, Blodwyn Pig, Taj Mahal, the Fugs. In those days deejays would
					play the whole side of an album. Nowadays some of your best XM/Sirius stations
					play deep tracks. We should all be proud that our music, what they were
					inventing back then, has lasted so long. Love—and the music of its time—is its
					own reward isn’t it? And having sex with the deejay while she’s playing “Whole
					Lotta Love” was the ultimate consummation of my radio sex music fantasy.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="sbdropcap">J</span>oe
					Perry, Joey Kramer (we went to the same high school in Yonkers), Tom Hamilton,
					and I arrived in Boston and got an apartment at 1325 Commonwealth Avenue in the
					fall of 1970, entering the city like spies, ready to conquer the world
					overnight. It took a little bit longer than we thought it would.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">With any of the bands I’d been in I’d always wished
					we could live together. I’d been dreaming of that since I was twelve, and now we
					could. We could write together, go to bed at night with the lick we wrote that
					afternoon fresh on our minds. The Island of Lost Boys.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Day one, I said to the guys, “This is so great that
					we’re living together! I fuckin’ love that!” It started out blissfully but soon
					turned into little skirmishes over chewing gum and toothpaste and petty
					psychological feuds. But that’s what marriages are. And in the end the band
					really worked, and I think somewhere deep inside—and quite hidden even from
					themselves!—they really loved me for making them do that when we lived at 1325.
					Stealing the food and cooking! I would make breakfast; we’d learn those songs
					and really craft them, make them tight.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">In his book, <span class="italic">Hit Hard: A Story
						of Hitting Rock Bottom at the Top,</span> Joey told the world that the
					reason he has a facial tic is that I abused him just like his father did. I used
					to yell at him. I’d say, “Don’t play it like that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. play it like
					this!” I know good things don’t come without practice; if I was hard on him it
					was because we had to get it right. But because I had decided not to be the
					drummer in the band, I gained a right <span class="caps">IN MY MIND</span> to be
					able to live vicariously through Joey.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I had a dream. So in the beginning, Joey was my
					interpreter, and we sat and played together. I took my drum set and said, “Joey,
					today’s the day.” And he’d go, “What, man?” And I’d go, “Well, you set up your
					drums and I’ll set up mine .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. right in front of you! And we’re
					gonna play facing each other.” He never understood. Later on, with Aerosmith
					records, he always thought that if I did a snare hit with him—or if I played the
					high hat while he played the drums—people would notice that there was someone
					else playing the drums. And I’d say, “Listen to Greg Allman’s ‘I’m No Angel’ or
					the Grateful Dead stuff with two drummers. It’s a <span class="italic">sound.
					</span>The Beatles sang in a room that had a voice .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. which means
					the room had an echo. They didn’t have some ass fuck engineer try to get rid of
					it. They put it on the track like that. Once it’s a hit, that echo is on there
					forever.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">A room has its own sound and music. You can buy a
					machine and tune it to “ambience.” When we were making <span class="italic">Just
						Push Play,</span> we recorded our empty room. If you record that hall noise
					and sing over it, it’s like letting the hall embrace you. It has chairs and
					equipment and people. The room IS another instrument. The room is in the
					band.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">So with Joey, we would play together, and in the
					beginning—what I’m getting at—is there’d be this Cheshire grin on both our
					faces. He loved me and I loved him. He couldn’t believe the tricks I knew. And
					to this day, he can play what I could never play. But back then, in ’71, it was
					all about “Hey, show me <span class="italic">that </span>again!”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Hence there was I, night after night, sitting near
					his drum riser, going, “Do a drum fill here,” ’cause he really didn’t know on
					his own that after the second verse—right after the prechorus, going into a
					chorus—one needs something exciting and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what would that be, Mr.
					Drummer? <span class="italic">A drum fill!</span> A prechorus means “Whoops,
					here it comes.” A verse should be the storytelling, and the prechorus is the
					“Whoops, here it comes.” And then a drum fill to go into it to show that it’s
						<span class="italic">important .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to mark its importance!
					</span>End of the song, maybe a prechorus again, and a middle eight
					(recapitulation), a little “tip o’ the hat” to something you might have said in
					the beginning of the song to remind everybody what it was about .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
					and <span class="caps">WHAMMO</span>, right into your chorus and you’re out. And
					during the chorus and the fade .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. come on, play the drums even
					more. These things I knew and learned and passed on to Joey. So he played, and
					for the last thirty-five years, I lived <span class="italic">through </span>him.
					I don’t know how <span class="italic">not</span> to.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">You know what one of my favorite albums of all time
					is? Stevie Wonder’s <span class="italic">Songs in the Key of Life, </span>mainly
					because of what drummer Raymond Pounds decided to do, which was, in essence,
						<span class="italic">not </span>live up to his last name. There are very few
					drum fills on that amazing record. You can be good just holding down the fort.
					On Zeppelin’s “Kashmir,” listen to that drum beat. Simple. Straight. It gives
					the song legs—like the linemen who protect the quarterback.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Since I’m a drummer and a perfectionist, I rode
					Joey hard, admittedly. But in the process I made him a better musician. Like
					when we’re sound checking in Hawaii, I sat down at the drums and wrote the drum
					line for “Walk This Way.” You want the story now or when we get to <span
						class="italic">Toys in the Attic</span>? Hey, I never said this was gonna be
					a completely linear read. How could it be? (Ha!) But we’re on <span class="caps"
						>DRUMS</span> so .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what the fuck?</p>
				<p class="x1bm-art-below" xml:lang="en-us">One of the things I’m most proud of is
					“Walk This Way,” and it’s very <span class="italic">EGO</span> and all, but even
					after you read the press about Run <span class="caps">DMC</span> and Rick Rubin,
					I still think the song was a <span class="caps">HIT</span> in and of itself. And
					the proof of the pudding .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. “<span class="italic">Backdoor lover
						always hiding ’neath the covers.</span>” You can’t <span class="caps"
						>SING</span> that unless you’re a drummer or have some major sense of
					rhythm.</p>
				<p class="art-1" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="generated-style-2"><img

				<p class="captions" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="caption-drop-cap">B</span>ackstage
					with Darryl (Run-D.M.C.) in 1982. (Ross Halfin)</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">So we’re at the HIC Arena in Honolulu, doin’ a
					sound check, and Joe was playing a riff and I went, “Whoa, whoa, whoa
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. STOP!” I ran over to the drums. Joey had not come out yet. He
					was backstage, and Joe and I just started jamming on the “Walk This Way” riff
					’cause Joe’s rhythm was fucking “get it!” <span class="italic">Bada da dump, ba
						dada dump bump (air) .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. bada da dump, ba dada dump bump.</span>
					I got on the drums and played to <span class="italic">that,</span> and that’s
					where the “Walk This Way” drum beat came from.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Joey wasn’t the best drummer in the world when I
					joined the band, and I was a drummer, and it was my theory of how a real band
					rehearses that fused the band together—playing that line from “Route 66” over
					and over and over again—and because I wrote the song “Somebody.” Eventually Joey
					achieved his independence as a drummer. He always had a hard time playing the
					rhythm at the end of “Train Kept a-Rollin’,” but he worked on his
					independence—that’s your ability to move all four of your limbs
					independently—and in the end he’s turned into the greatest drummer in rock ’n’
					roll. He now has a right ankle that’s like a bicep from playing the bass
					drum.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Joey says I drove him crazy, gave him a nervous
					breakdown. When we were in rehab together at Steps in Malibu in 1996, the class
					confronted me. “What’s the big idea of bringing someone here who’s an active
					addict?” I said, “What the fuck are you talking about?” “Your drummer, your
					drummer’s on cocaine, he’s got that tic addicts get from snorting coke.” Then I
					had to explain—but I had no idea <span class="italic">I </span>was the
					explanation.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Okay, so we’re all living and working together and
					we’re getting these early gigs. Sure, there’s friction from time to time, but
					nobody in the band has doubts that we are going to make it. Everybody was
					totally committed. No band I was ever in had gone to that extent. Prior to
					moving to 1325 I would look at Tom and go, “You’re not leaving, right?” “Are you
					a quitter?” “We’re doing this, right?” Nowadays, there are fewer places for a
					young band to set up and play .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and suck. Dare to suck! We did—you
					can, too!</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Joey Kramer’s the one who brought that funk and
					shit to Aerosmith because he was playing in black bands and he thought he was
					all that. Of course, he had no idea what he was going to blossom into. He’s so
						dis-<span class="italic">tinc</span>-tive. Even his mistakes <span
						class="italic">fly-y-y-y</span>!</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">And then there was my old buddy and gang mate Ray
					Tabano. He was there from the beginning. Not the greatest guitar player on the
					planet but one hell of a crazy motherfucker. Crazy Raymond. And I wanted the
					sound of two guitars in this band (eye, E .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the Stones). After a
					year or so Brad Whitford would replace Ray (in 1971).</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Like a lot of bands, we lived in the same house,
					played, got drunk, went to drug school together, stole to eat. We had no money
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we were starving to death back then. I was stealing food from
					the Stop and Shop (rechristened the Stop and Steal). I’d go to the store and get
					some ground beef and shove it down my jeans to throw in with the rice. I’d make
					that Gravy Train shit that I could pour over some bread with brown rice and
					carrots. And then the six of us ate.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-art-below" xml:lang="en-us">The psychological warfare began with
					milk—which is pretty funny, because it was over spilt milk that the band broke
					up in 1979. I’d get the milk in the morning and put it in the refrigerator; then
					I’d go to get a drink of milk and what the fuck, there’s just a drop of milk
					left. “Well, at least we left you <span class="italic">something</span>!” they’d
					say. And there it is .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. there’s the psycho<span class="italic"
						>lacto</span>logical crux of the thing, and that’s pretty much as humorous
					as I can get about our petty daily band frictions. I’ve gotten real mad, but I
					never actually <span class="italic">hit</span> anybody in the band. That nobody
					ever hit <span class="italic">me</span> is a testament to their forbearance. I
					probably drove everyone nuts.</p>

				<p class="x1bm-art-below" xml:lang="en-us">But if you don’t bring this shit out into
					the light it gets suppressed and festers. Bands try and avoid aggravation, but
					hell, it can actually inspire you to write better songs. One day at the very
					beginning of 1971 I wrote the basic track and lyrics for “Movin’ Out” on a
					water bed with Joe Perry in our living room at 1325 Com. Ave. I leaped up and
					shouted, “Guys! Do you realize what we just did?” Their enthusiasm was curbed.
					“Yeah, what is it, man?” “It’s our firstborn!” I proclaimed. “The first <span

					“Move over, you’re blocking the TV,” they’d whine. “No, man,” I said, “let’s go
					write some more songs!” “<span class="italic">Bah!</span> Get the fuck outta
					here!” and they’d flick their joints at me. I got really fucking pissed off at
					these guys, went in the other room, sat down at the piano, and wrote another
					verse to “Movin’ Out,” finished up <span class="italic">“</span>Make It, Don’t
					Break It,” and worked on “Dream On.” And just did a shitload of stuff. Love may
					be the best driving wheel, but anger is a pretty good second.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="sbdropcap">T</span>he
					albums that had a huge effect on me were <span class="italic">Taj Mahal</span>
					and <span class="italic">Deep Purple</span>—a mixture of Taj Mahal and the
					Yardbirds. That’s what I brought to Aerosmith. I said, “These albums are gonna
					be our Bible, let’s have at it.” Taj Mahal. God, his album was so instrumental
					for me, leaving all those cover bands and doing Aerosmith. I named my son for
					Taj. It was Taj Mahal singing “Going Up to the Country, Paint My Mailbox Blue”
					right out in the open with his harmonica—that first album, I still listen to
					it.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">We got “Train Kept a-Rollin” from the Yardbirds,
					but it started as an R&amp;B hit for Tiny Bradshaw, who was a swing band leader.
					Johnny Burnette hillbillyized it in the fifties and the Yardbirds just <span
						class="italic">smoked</span> it. What did we have to lose? I always wanted
					to do “Road Runner”—my totem critter. Bo Diddley’s version Britbluesisized by
					the Pretty Things.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">The first thing you got to do is get yourself a

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Now, any idiot can basically buy that kit. A
					bald-headed accountant in a fright wig and tight spandex can do it and end up on
					the cover of a heavy metal mag. But in the dazed and confused days of yore, the
					mystic moves of Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page, and Peter Green were only revealed to
					true believers.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">When Jimmy Page came to Boston on the<span
						class="italic"> Outrider </span>tour in June of 1988 and dedicated “Train
					Kept a-Rollin’ ” to” “Steven and Joe from Aerosmith,” that was like a blessing
					from one of our gods.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">We rehearsed at Boston University, down in the
					basement of the girls’ dorm. Jeff Green, the director of the West Campus One
					dorms, was a heavyset guy who loved the band and let us practice there for free.
					We rehearsed until four thirty and then hitched a ride back to the apartment so
					we could all watch <span class="italic">The Three Stooges</span> at five on
					Channel 38 and share a bong full of brown Mexican marijuana. Let’s get stupid.
					Well, not everybody gets stupid. I actually think I wrote some good lyrics on
					pot, but meth, coke, and Tuinals were my drugs of choice.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">In Joe Perry I’d seen raw power .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but
					how to harness it? One day it dawned on me why Led Zeppelin was the shit. Jimmy
					Page figured it out, and it wasn’t <span class="italic">jamming. </span>Everyone
					in that band knew what they were playing and played the same rhythm. I heard Joe
					Perry, Tom Hamilton, and Pudge Scott jamming back at the Barn in Sunapee<span
						class="italic">.</span> I was blown away by their unleashed fury, but I
					wasn’t crazy about their rambling, indulgent noodling. “Hey, we’re jammin’,
					man,” they’d say. They even <span class="italic">called</span> themselves the
					Jam Band. My answer to that was “Yah and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what? <span
						class="italic">What?!</span>” There’s nothing so great about three people
						<span class="italic">jamming.</span> It’s all egotistical, all over the
					place. So I said, “How about instead of each of you going off on your own
					tangents, you all play in sync?” Now, there’s balls! “You guys, we gotta play
						<span class="italic">together</span>. We can’t jam and be a big fuckin’ rock
					band. The foot’s gotta play with the bass—then we’ll have a serious fucking rock
					machine.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">There are secrets to rock, just as there are

						send this light” </span>to cure an illness, to achieve some deep purpose in
					your life, it <span class="italic">will</span> happen, because there is no power
					on earth stronger than that. There’s electromagnetic theory behind it. If I
					hooked up that energy at the instant you came to an electrode it would go <span
						class="italic">mmmmmnnnbrrrrggggnnnnnnn.</span> The little red needle would
					thrash like a rattlesnake’s tail.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Now, what if you had a thought <span class="italic"
						>while</span> your electricity was ramped up? What if your every thought had
					an electrical charge attached to it that got overamped during sex? When the two
					orgasms combine they have unbelievable psychic power. The English occultist
					Alistair Crowley based his ritual Magick on this principle. And it’s an
					interesting fact that for a dozen years in the seventies and eighties, Jimmy
					Page owned Bolskine House, Crowley’s old home on the shore of Loch Ness—so who
					knows what effect Crowley’s Magick had on the serpentine rise of Led
					Zeppelin?</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I’ve practiced that Crowley Magick so I know it
					works. I’m not saying that every girl I slept with came at the same time as I
					did or that I asked her to pray for the same thing I was praying for: namely
					that Aerosmith would become the greatest American band. But then I didn’t have
					to, because that’s all I ever thought about .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or prayed for.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="sbdropcap">E</span>very kid
					on every block in every city in America wants to be a rock star. But if girls,
					money, fast cars, houses in Maui, and skybox seats to Red Sox games are your
					only motivation—and that’s <span class="italic">a lot</span> of motivation—then
					you’re in trouble. Aerosmith has been together—the five of us—for forty years,
					with a short two-year break, and you don’t get to do that without some very
					strong motivating force to counterbalance all the stupid fucked-up things that
					are constantly working to tear you apart. The psychic glue that held us together
					was <span class="italic">the music.</span> The collective sound that the five of
					us make. Peel back the layers of the onion (that’s what it is) .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
					and when it works, it’s above and beyond your wildest dreams.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Like it must have been for Jimi Hendrix’s band. His
					music was so heavy that when you hear the thunderous, orgasmic opening to
					“Purple Haze,” you don’t have to <span class="italic">say</span> anything. You
					can imagine Jimi’s drummer, Mitch Mitchell, listening to that playback and
					going, “Oh, my god! <span class="italic">Oh, my god!</span>” The rush and din of
					it sucked you in, it pulled you under. It was magnetic, utterly addictive—you
					would follow that sound to the ends of the earth. It’s not something you can
					walk away from. It’s the sound of humping, pumping, grinding life itself—with a
					voodoo vibe to it.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I remember my first girlfriend, Geraldine Ripetti,
					saying, “I heard this song on the radio—I’ve never heard music that sexy.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“What do you mean?”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">She goes, “ ‘Purple Haze.’ ”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Gerry Ripetti had the biggest boobs—I couldn’t even
					look at them while I was standing in front of her, they were so big, it so
					affected me, I was st-st-stuttering, be-be-be-because. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. She was
					so beautiful. She said, “Steven, you’ve got to hear this record, this is the
					sexiest music I ever heard.” And just hearing her say “sexiest music” I could
					feel the lump already arising in my pants. “Sexy? What do you mean by that?” She
					played me “Are You Experienced?” and, come on! She was so fucking right on,
					because when you heard those Stratocasting gears churning .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that
					was sex as sound in its purest primal form.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">No one had ever played like that. No one. So
					imagine being in his band and saying, “We just <span class="italic"
						>played</span> that.” Or the Stones creating that raunchy spooky blues vibe,
					that <span class="italic">energy, </span>that <span class="italic"
						>tangible</span> force that could <span class="italic">not</span> be denied,
					it had to be reckoned with. A sound that would be the mouthpiece for a whole
					generation. When you think about rock bands that made it, why did they make it,
						<span class="italic">how</span> did they make it, what did they make it
						<span class="italic">for—</span>I can get really emotional about this stuff.
					Because the <span class="italic">music</span> that they made was so strong, so
					overwhelming that it was a prayer and an answer all at once.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">The Beatles, come on, and what the fuck! It wasn’t
					because they were all such great musicians. They knew. They knew. They were
					English and they had long hair when nobody else did and they said funny things,
					but it wasn’t that, either. It was the alchemy they cooked up—Everly Brothers,
					Buddy Holly, Little Richard, Chuck Berry—and music hall numbers.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">And they evolved, as did the Stones, the Who. Many
					groups came out, had a hit, and then took the ferry back across the Mersey. The
					Beatles went from “She Loves You” to “Help” within a year. In one year. Not ten.
					In two years they were at the trippy <span class="italic">Rubber Soul</span>.
					“Norwegian Wood,” how great is that? So you can say what you want, but in one
					year they started out recording in a room where Paul and John sang together on
					one mic, took that vocal and dumped it down to one track, and added it to the
					next vocals. You know what that means? It means you can’t go back. They had to
					be so sure of themselves. Plus, of course, they had George Martin as a
					producer.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="sbdropcap">W</span>e needed
					a name, so we all got together and tossed names around the table, like Stit
					Jane. I came up with the Hookers. No one liked that. “How about Arrowsmith,”
					Joey suggested. “<span class="italic">Arrowsmith?</span> You mean like the
					Sinclair Lewis novel we had to read in high school?” And then, a minute later, I
					went “Aero: a-e-r-o, right?” And he goes, “Yeah.” Now <span class="italic"
						>that</span> was cool. The name evoked space—aerodynamics, supersonic
					thrust, Mach II, the sound barrier. I thought if we could stay together, that
					name would always work because we had nothing to look forward to except the
					future. I always imagined that when I was fifty, there’d be robots already,
					skateboards that floated and you could jump on. Everything that happened to me
					since I was ten came out of comic books anyway. All the superheroes had that
					shit. Every bit of it—lasers, light sabers, phones that you could talk into.
					Dick Tracy had that watch on his arm. He was talking to it all the time.
					Watching <span class="italic">Dick Tracy</span> I used to think, “What if we all
					had one of those watches?”—but it was just a crazy kid thought. Now everyone has
					one with all the apps—check your e-mail, blog, Twitter me .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and
					please, sit on my Facebook.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I’d thought of calling us the Hookers because I
					considered playing clubs a form of prostitution—I’d spent six years playing
					clubs in New York and knew how exhausting and frustrating it was. So with
					Aerosmith we avoided the club scene like the plague. It’s a trap. The money’s
					okay—a thousand a week would be a nice payday—but doing four sets a night (for
					forty-five minutes each, even if the club was empty) for a two-week stretch
					playing other people’s material will grind you down. No time to rehearse, write,
					develop new material. People shouting “Play ‘Maggie May’!” “Hey, you fucks, know
					any Credence songs?” In any case we were too rowdy for most clubs and bars. We
					got kicked out of Bunratty’s Bar in Boston because we started to incorporate
					original material and the club owners didn’t like that.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Instead we focused on colleges, high school dances,
					ski lodges. We played around a lot, mostly weekends, rehearsing during the week.
					Playing high school dances out in the country, getting maybe three hundred
					dollars a night.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">We played absolutely anywhere that fifty people
					would come see us. As the keeper of our gig calendar, I had to make sure we had
					at least three dates a month for around three hundred dollars to cover our rent
					and basic nut. We functioned like a guerrilla band: play a small town, establish
					a beachhead, develop a small fan base, next time through there’d be more kids
					and more and more enthusiastic fans.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Our set list was our Brit blues catechism. Real
					heavy metal to me is Led Zeppelin playing “Dazed and Confused.” We got our roots
					the same place Zeppelin got theirs—and I don’t mean from Jake Holmes, the guy
					who inspired Jimmy Page—I mean de blooze.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">When we started out, there must have been five
					thousand rock ’n’ roll bands in the Boston area alone trying to make it. But if
					you are going to separate yourself from the pack you have to develop your own
					identity and you aren’t going to do that by playing other people’s songs. In the
					very beginning we, too, did cover versions (we only had a couple of our own
					songs).</p>
				<p class="x1bm-art-below" xml:lang="en-us">We never played in our street clothes. We
					always dressed up .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. put on a show. You’re in a band, lads, we’ve
					got to get <span class="italic">flash</span>. The look is the hook. I got the
					band to strut their stuff, dress up, get their sartorial swagger on. I’d walk
					into Caprice, an antiques store on Newberry Street owned by my friend Barbara
					Brown. She said to come down to her store and she’d give us some clothes for our
					first album photo shoot. I had to ease the guys into the fashion thing. I was
					already having my leather pants done in flames from the girl who lived upstairs
					at Number 5, Kent Street. I brought the band to Caprice and told ’em to rummage
					around, pick their own stuff out. It was a free-for-all.</p>

				<p class="captions" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="caption-drop-cap">A</span>t
					Barbara Brown’s store with Joe Perry.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I brought the band
					here for clothes for the first album in 1972. (Robert Agriopoulos)</p>
				
				
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">The store was opposite Intermedia Sound where we
					would record our first album. “Here, put this on!” I said. “Hell, no, I’m not
					gonna wear <span class="italic">that</span>.” “Aw, c’mon, man, just do it for
					the pictures! Look at the Brit art school flash! Look at Jimmy Page! Look at
					Mick! Look at Jimi Hendrix, Jeff Beck! Look at Pete Townshend! The Union Jack
					jacket is the shit. Are they wearing jeans and army surplus? I don’t think so.”
					After a lot of yacking they got into the clothes that made the picture on the
					first LP cover explode .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and they looked fucking great.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">That photo was taken on the stoop in front of
					Barbara’s store. Brad had one of her shirts on, Joey’s got her jacket, I wore
					the hat and the belt. That’s it, baby. We got the shot, and then some brain-dead
					police working at Columbia shrank it down and put clouds behind it—the beginning
					of my corporate hell.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">We raided the closets of the hipoisie. A mad mix of
					King’s Road medieval motley, pimp swagger, Stones gypsy gear and Carnaby Street
					kitsch. Janis’s Haight-Ashbury scarf-draped bordello exotica (god, I’m getting
					off just saying this!) and a touch of titillating androgyny for shits and
					wiggles. Anything startling, garish, glam, and over-the-top: jewelry, earrings,
					black lace, feathers, metal flake, eyeliner. All the stuff we need to look cool
					and out there. Whatever it takes to spark that outlandish rock star impudence.
					Anything that denotes snotty, defiant arrogance and beyond-the-pale chic. <span
						class="italic">Let your freak flag fly!</span> And a few Aerosmith tattoos
					just to underline the outlaw element. Find out where they are, folks!</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">We were perfect for the dandified Brit look. We
					weren’t pumped .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. on the contrary, we were skinny and weedy, just
					like the English musicians. Anyway, our outfits paled beside those of the New
					York Dolls: hot pants, fake leopard skin, black nail polish, panty hose,
					bouffant hairdos, feather boas, and six-inch platforms.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Most of this band’s early career had been spent
					making fun of me for what I wore—clothes and shoes—and then they’d wind up
					wearing it themselves. I’d put jewelry on the guys in the band and there would
					be a comment. Joe has said to me more than once about my style or what I was
					wearing, “Wow, I love those pants. Do they make ’em for guys?” At first—and for
					a very long time thereafter—Joe was <span class="italic">aloof. </span>When I’d
					point out that this is the stuff Mick, Keith, and Jimmy Page wore, he’d say,
					“What do I want to look like him for? I’m <span class="italic">me.</span>” I
					just wanted to be a gypsy. Interestingly enough, whatever Joe’s own thing is,
					your thing, anyone’s thing, that’s it. That’s where the song “Make It” came
					from.</p>
				<p class="x1song-first" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">You know that history

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I lifted those lyrics out of the creative ether
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. my inner voice. I live and stand by it. You’ve got to make up
					your own shit out of what’s already there. I always figured, “I don’t know what
					I’m doing, but I know I’m doing it!”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I kind of got offended when Madonna came out with
					her thrift shop chic like she’d invented it. That’s the way everyone dressed
					from 1966 to Woodstock. And then in the eighties, Madonna came out with
					“Material Girl” and her bangles and stuff and I went, “Yes!” Wow, what a fickle,
					fuckin’ mass media! Because nowadays, everything’s recycled. There’s nothing
					new. Everything’s in quotation marks. What <span class="italic">wasn’t</span>
					before? Gypsy Boots, he was the <span class="italic">first </span>nature boy,
					living in a tree and dressing like it’s 1969.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="sbdropcap">M</span>y dream
					had come true, but the second I said, “It’s so great that we’re all living
					together,” Joey moved in with his girlfriend, Nina Lausch, and Joe moved out
					with Elyssa. Was it my breath? We were a unit, watching the sparks fly, day or
					night. Didn’t they know that some of the best creative shit came in the midnight
					hour? In my other bands I’d seen how women led to a breakup—look at the
					Beatles—and I didn’t want that to happen to us. I pleaded with my <span
						class="italic">brother</span>. “Joe! You’re Joe <span class="italic">fuckin’
					</span>Perry .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you’re the ultimate, the
					beyond-which-there-is-nothing—when I met you, I knew I’d found my guy. Come on
					now, man .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you gotta stay. We gotta write together .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
					that’s the whole reason I moved to Boston.” But to no avail.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I was angry at Elyssa because she stole my
					boyfriend, my significant other, my partner in crime! It was like losing a
					brother. So now there was jealousy, this dark undercurrent humming along. I felt
					that Joe abandoned me—that he cared more about Elyssa than he did about the
					band. After all these years, it’s okay to admit it. I was really hurt that he
					would rather be with Elyssa than be with me, especially after we started writing
					songs together. Like I said earlier with “Movin’ Out,” Joe’s sitting on the
					water bed and I hear him strumming this thing and I go, “Hold on .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
					whoa, what’s that?” and a minute later, Joe’s riffing and I’m
					scribbling&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
				<p class="x1song-first" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">We all live on the
						edge of town</span></p>
				<p class="x1song-last" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">Where we all live there
						ain’t a soul around</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">And it was in the afternoon, and that song wouldn’t
					have happened unless we’d been living <span class="italic">together.
					</span>Writing songs <span class="italic">was</span> fucking. I took my anger
					and jealousy and eventually put it into “Sweet Emotion,” which I pointed at
					Elyssa directly .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
				<p class="x1song-first" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">You talk about things
						that nobody cares,</span></p>
				<p class="x1song-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">You’re wearing out
						things that nobody wears</span></p>
				<p class="x1song-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">Calling my name but I
						gotta make clear</span></p>
				<p class="x1song-last" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">I can’t tell ya honey
						where I’ll be in a year</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I used my jealousy and anger for lyrical
					inspiration. Looking back, I’m actually grateful that Joe moved out with Elyssa.
					It gave me something to sing about, a bittersweet emotion. My relationship with
					Joe is fraught to say the least. Even in the best of times we sometimes don’t
					speak for months. On tour we’re brothers, soul mates, but there’s always an
					underlying tension broken up by moments of ecstasy and periods of pure rage.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Mutual animosity is a necessary part of a band’s
					chemistry. It’s all egos in a band, anyway. Would you want to be in a group who
					were all clones of yourself? Pretty much anyone who wants to be a rock star is
					by definition a raging narcissist—then just add drugs! It may be one for all and
					all for one, but each one of us is an egomaniac, we’re all in it for gain and
					glory and showing the world how fucking great we are. It’s <span class="italic"
						>me</span>! And when you have five me’s .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">They say, “As long as you can keep that competition
					healthy, it’s all good, dog. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” But just try to be that reasonable
					when you’re eighteen or even twenty-six. The only way this actually works in a
					positive way is also out of ego, when, say, Joe or Brad comes up with a riff and
					I think, fuck, that’s great, and I want to try and top it by reversing the
					melody or writing a lyric that will blow everybody away.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Joe and I are opposites in many ways
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and that’s what fueled our creativity. So I knew if we were
					going to run like that, it would inevitably cause a lot of tension. The friction
					between us started almost immediately—when Aerosmith played their first gig, at
					Boston’s Nipmuc Regional High School, on November 6, 1970. We’d barely gotten
					through the first number when I began shouting at him. “Turn your fucking amp
					the fuck down! You don’t need to be so fuckin’ loud!” I couldn’t hear myself
					singing. I can’t sing in the key of the band if I can’t hear my voice. I need to
					hear my voice over the music to know if I’m in tune. Truth is, the energy was so
						<span class="italic">there </span>with the band, it didn’t matter whether I
					heard myself or not. That was a private inside joke between me, myself, and I. I
					came from the club days before monitors and held my finger in my ear so I could
					hear myself. Like my dad says: “If you have bad ears .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I sound
					pretty good.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I’ve had constant blowups with Joe about how loud
					his amp is. Remember in <span class="italic">Spinal Tap </span>when Nigel Tufnel
					shows the rockumentary director the <span class="italic">11 </span>setting on
					his amp? Well, my guitar player definitely had his amp turned up to 12! I tuned
					Joe’s guitar for him way back then because his ears were already damaged by the
					volume. They’re still shot. Joe’s had tinnitus for years. What he hears most of
					the time is a high-pitched whine.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-art-below" xml:lang="en-us">You want opposites in a band, that’s what
					makes the big wheel turn and the sparks fly .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but when you have
					such widely differing personalities there are going to be some upsetting
					exchanges. Joey told me about the time we were on Newbury Street at Intermedia
					Studio. Joey was on one side of the street and Joe was walking on the other
					side. Joey crossed the street to be next to Joe and said, “Hey, Joe, how ya
					doin’? Can I walk with ya?” He was full of that <span class="italic">wow and
						wonder</span> of recording our first album and just plain being Joey Kramer,
					who happens to have the biggest heart in the band. And Joe says, “Yeah, sure.”
					Pause. “So, Joe,” Joey asks him, “why can’t we be friends?” And Joe doesn’t even
					pause before he fires back, “Why? Just because we’re in a band, we gotta be
					friends?” Which was pretty harsh. Now, Joe may say today, “Well, I was just
					fuckin’ with him!” Really? Well, there was a lot of wounded silence hanging
					there as Joey walked away. He never forgot it.</p>

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">In a group it’s always about “who the fuck <span

				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="sbdropcap">A</span>t the
					beginning of December 1971 we got booked into the Academy of Music on Fourteenth
					Street in New York, third on the bill with Humble Pie and Edgar Winter’s band.
					We packed all our gear in a bus and headed down there. We had no bass amps—we
					borrowed some to get on that stage and play. Steve Paul was the promoter. He
					managed the Winter Brothers, the two albino blues musicians from Texas, Johnny
					and Edgar. Johnny had just got out of rehab that night, but at that time Edgar
					was the bigger Winter. The Academy of Music was the biggest gig we’d had, where
					I’d seen the Stones some years before.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Right before the Stones came onstage, I could see
					Keith’s boots and the high heels and I knew it was them and I just about fucking
					wet my pants. I was freaking, the audience was screaming, the lights were down,
					but you could see those boots. Then, years later, I’m sitting with Keith,
					shortly after his father died, at Dick Friedman’s house (he owns the Charles
					Hotel on Martha’s Vineyard) and we’re smoking cigars, discussing life and shit.
					Talk about surreal, I felt my mind going back to that very Stones show and the
					image of those boots.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-art-below" xml:lang="en-us">Anyway, I’m backstage at the Academy
					going, “Oh, my god!” On top of which Steve Paul was considering managing us. I
					knew Steve from his club, the Scene, on Forty-sixth Street. I played at the
					Scene with the McCoys, Rick Derringer’s band. Derringer was backstage at the
					Academy of Music tuning his own guitar by doing a method called “Octaves.” You
					hit an E octave up and you get a harmonic, and when it stops <span
						class="italic">waving,</span> then you’re in tune. I called the guys over.
					“Joe, Brad—you gotta see this! It’s a way of tuning without me using the
					harmonica.” I’d spent the last two years tuning the guys onstage with an E
					harmonica in my mouth. I would tune Joe’s E string and they’d try and take it
					from there. Now the guys could tune their own guitars. Bloody hell! Genius. I
					saw Derringer play live at Klein’s department store in Yonkers in like ’67 or
					’68 doing “Hang On Sloopy.” He had to have been sixteen years old. I was dazzled
					to death.</p>

					play three songs and get off. We did all originals: “Make It,” “One Way Street,”
					and “Major Barbara.” For whatever reason, on “Major Barbara” Joe and I decided
					to sit down and play.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">We weren’t sure of really anything except making an
					impression and getting our songs right. The audience started chanting, “We want
					Edgar!” so I butted the songs up so close together; that way the crowd didn’t
					have time to heckle us. We shouldered on and jammed. If we stopped playing for
					twenty seconds, we’d get a loud “<span class="caps">BOOO</span>” from the crowd.
					It didn’t feel good. “Major Barbara,” a song we’ve never released, had gone over
					quite well—no boos, just a couple of shouts. Under that kind of pressure you
					don’t know what you’re doing .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you just go with whatever you have
					and try not to give a shit, which we did. So we just launched into “Walkin’ the
					Dog.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">We could see Steve Paul in the wings getting
					apoplectic. “Get them off!” But we continued on and finished our set. As we got
					off the stage, Steve Paul pulled me to the side of the stage and gave me a lobe
					full. “Don’t you <span class="italic">ever</span> sit down at a show that I
					book!”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Years later I was out at Steve Paul’s house with my
					first wife, Cyrinda. “I have to tell you something, Steven,” he said. “If it
					hadn’t been for that stupid stunt where you and Joe sat down on the stage during
					‘Major Barbara,’ I’d have become your manager.” Joke’s on you, Steve! Looking
					back, it was a ballsy thing to do .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. sitting down. Nowadays, you
					call that an acoustic set. Unplugged. We just sat down so Joe could play slide
					on his guitar. It was very ahead of its time. And Joe played a great slide.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">The apartment at 1325 was on the second floor, so
					when we came back from a gig we’d hump all our shit up the stairs. One night as
					we were unloading, I spotted a small suitcase lying against a telephone pole. I
					looked around, no one was there, so I snuck it upstairs real quick. Inside was a
					lot of dirty laundry, an ounce of pot, and eighteen hundred dollars. Wow! I
					grabbed the pot and the cash and took the suitcase back down and put it back in
					the spot where I found it. “No one will <span class="italic">ever</span> think I
					took it,” I told myself. There was no one else around, but obviously someone was
					going to come looking for this stuff. And they weren’t going to think it was the
					little old lady on the fifth floor who took it. Had to be the guys in Aerosmith
					unloading their van.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I took the cash, bought an RMI (Rocky Mountain
					Instruments) keyboard, and took it out on the road. I worked up “Dream On” on it
					and played it at our next gig. You know, the Sheboo Inn or whatever it was—the
					Fish Kettle Inn or the Fish Kitten Inn.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Eventually two thuggish guys showed up and demanded
					the suitcase, the money, and the pot. They had guns. Fuck! What now?! Out of the
					basement comes our biker super (and first security guy), Gary Cabozzi
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. who was something of a maniac, not to mention <span class="caps"
						>HUGE</span>. Toothless, bald, 350 pounds of fucking flaming angry I-talian
					quivering flesh who would be delighted to kick the shit out of anyone who came
					near the band for whatever reason, waving a Civil War saber. “I’ve already
					called the cops,” he says to the thugs. “So get out of here. The cops will be
					here any minute.” And the guys put their guns down and ran .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. never
					to be seen again.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-art-below" xml:lang="en-us">We were going to follow our quest to the
					bitter end, but by December of 1971 we were pretty much at the end of our tether
					and of everything else, too. No money, no food, no gigs, nowhere to rehearse,
					and nineteen dollars in the bank. I’m always one for taking things to the wall,
					but occasionally you actually <span class="italic">hit</span> the wall. We were
					at a dead end, our last gasp—and then we got an eviction notice. And just at
					that moment an angel appeared unto us in the form of a well-connected Irish
					promoter named Frank Connally.</p>

				<p class="captions" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="caption-drop-cap">O</span>ur first
					billboard, Kenmore Square, Boston, 1972. (Steven Tallarico)</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Through a guy who played in a local band, we heard
					about a rehearsal space at Fenway Theater on Massachusetts Avenue. John O’Toole
					was the manager there and gave us our first big break when the hard rock group
					Cactus canceled because of a snowstorm, and we filled in for them. John O’Toole
					put us in touch with Frank Connally, who had brought the Beatles, Hendrix, and
					Led Zeppelin to Boston. Frank was connected to the movers and shakers of Boston,
					and he believed in us in an epic way—in the same way we believed in ourselves.
					To wit that, as unlikely as it seemed at the time, we would become the greatest
					rock ’n’ roll band in the world. And, as future superstars, he gave us a
					salary—a hundred a week each.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Frank wanted us to do it all over again. At first I
					was a little pissed off because I’d spent the last five years playing every club
					in New York and Long Island. But Frank knew that this new band was going
					somewhere, so he got us to play this new club in Massachusetts for a month to
					hone our chops and build a buzz.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Father Frank was a brilliant promoter and a
					visionary—he understood us—but he didn’t have the connections we needed to get a
					record contract, so he became partners with two guys from New York, David Krebs
					and Steve Leber, who knew the record business. They managed the New York Dolls,
					the hippest, most outrageous band around, so we were thrilled—initially, anyway.
					They would arrange for us to perform at a showcase for the major record
					companies at Max’s Kansas City. They also helped us out of a few jams. Frank
					died from cancer some years later and the voices inside me said he knew
					something was going on .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. so he passed us over to Leber and
					Krebs.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Probably through some other-world connection of
					Father Frank’s, we occasionally played seedy joints like Scarborough Fair, a
					Boston bar where you could get shot for saying the wrong thing to the wrong
					person. One New Year’s Eve we were playing a gig there. The place was packed
					with bikers and local thugs. A great hairy biker chick came up to us and gave
					the band a nasty arm’s-length <span class="italic">fuck you.</span> “Hey,” I
					said, “I can see your string hangin’.” A gasp went up from the crowd in the bar,
					and right then I knew we were in serious fucking trouble. She was the girlfriend
					of the president of the Trampers, a gang of bikers that were too lame to make it
					into the Hells Angels .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a “menstrual cycle gang” I called them.
					The guys in the crew told us that I’d insulted the biker babe’s honor and the
					Trampers were lined up outside and were going to stomp us all to death. I am, I
					admit, a foul-mouthed individual. None other than Chuck Berry dubbed us “full of
					soul—and full of filth.” I was forced to make a groveling apology to the girl;
					then we called the cops and got the hell out of there.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">We started out doing tours of clubs and colleges
					around the Northeast in an Olds Delta 88, amply fortified with drugs. Which
					makes the highway a little hairy. It was just around the beginning of Aerosmith,
					’71, ’72, playing a gig in some godforsaken place, we were on the New Jersey
					Turnpike and the fucking cops pulled us over. They found some pot in someone’s
					bag in the trunk. I had put a bag of pot down my pants. Brad had two ounces of
					pot stuffed in his right pocket, Tom had a couple of roaches in a film canister,
					and my hash coffin—that infamous tiny metal box—had some hash dust and a
					Nembutal in it. The cops saw us throw the pot out the window of the car.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">So off to the police station. We were handcuffed to
					this bar that ran along a wall that looked like a dance bar. I still have the
					pot down my pants and am handcuffed to Joe, but I had one free hand. When the
					cops went to go book us they said, “You know, that’s the Aerosmith guy.” “Oh,
					really?” came the echo. We were kind of known, but not that well known. They
					left us in the hallway, and as soon as there was a moment where no one was
					around, I took the pot out really quick and threw it across the room. We wound
					up in Booking. They let us go one at a time. “What’s your name? Stand there.
					Your weight?” And as they were taking a picture I looked up, and <span
						class="italic">right</span> on his desk is where the bag of pot had landed.
					The cop never saw it!</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I thought, <span class="italic">that</span> is it!
					I went, “Hey, you guys, look!” And they went, “Shut up!” all nervous and shit.
					That’s my band. Beavis and Butthead would have gone, “Heh-heh-heh, that’s so
					fucking cool!” But my band was, “Shut up! You’re gonna get us busted!” I think
					Joey had it down his pants. By some miracle .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <span class="italic"
						>misplaced evidence .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. </span>and help from our managers,
					Leber-Krebs, who got us the heavy-hitting lawyers—we were all slapped with
					misdemeanors and then released. Back on the road to ruin!</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Early tours were very simple affairs. We had the
					two Joes—limousine drivers from Buffalo who drove us around the Midwest—plus a
					station wagon for the bags. Both drivers were Italian and pretty dumb, but one
					of them was way dumber. Joe the Dumber won the Golden Sow Award for pulling this
					girl backstage in Terra Haute; she had a little sailor outfit on, white pleated
					skirt and the whole bit, a big healthy corn-fed State Fair girl.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">One of the best things the band did early on was to
					use that billboard in Copley Square. Raymond came up with the idea. The
					billboard had had nothing on it for a while, so we worked out a deal with them
					to put the Aerosmith wings up. This was after we got the wings redesigned. The
					first Aerosmith backdrop cloth had the A logo with wings on it, but they look
					like bat wings, little stubby things.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">The deal with the billboard company was that we
					could put our logo up and then when somebody wanted to come and rent it, fine,
					they could just cover it over. It was up there for a long time. Anybody that
					came in or out of Boston saw those wings before they even knew who we were. That
					was ’72, ’73. It was above New England Music City. Fenway Park is right there.
					You go over that little footbridge and you’re in the park.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Those were the days. New England Music City was a
					record store; it was about the size of probably the bathroom of a hotel suite. A
					tiny little corner store. It’s probably a Cumberland Farms franchise or a Store
					24 now. But that was where you’d go and flip through the records back in the
					day; you could read all about the bands on the back of the album.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">After 1325 Com. Ave. we rented a house at 39 Kent
					Street in Boston with all these sailors. Back then we were lowlifes who didn’t
					live anywhere and were just barely getting by. We made our first tapes at my
					friend Rick Smith’s house—he’s now a manager. Rick had a rich college friend who
					had tape recorders, so we got a chance to record things like “Walkin’ the Dog”
					and shit like that before we made our first album. And that’s where we began to
					start thinking seriously about making a record and saw that we could. They had a
					room that was all lined with cork so you could laugh and sing and play late at
					night, and no one would hear you.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">At that time I was hanging out with Buddy Miles. He
					had this giant silver skull full of cocaine. The night I met the<span
						class="italic"> skull,</span> David Hull and Charlie Farren (Buddy’s guitar
					and bass player) joined us in the living room, where the drummer told all these
					wild tales. Buddy had been in a lot of famous bands. He’d played with Duke
					Ellington, Charlie Parker, Wilson Pickett, Mike Bloomfield’s Electric Flag, and
					had been the drummer in Jimi Hendrix’s last group, Band of Gypsys. I asked Buddy
					questions about what it was like to go on tour. “Where do you stay? What do you
					do? The girls, do they come to your room? Oh, you go down to the bar and find
					them there? Oh yeah!” I had never actually gone on tour yet. What we did in the
					early days was do one-offs. He told us what it was like to be on the road, the
					perks, so to speak, and I was flabbergasted. It was my first taste of what I
					wanted.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-art-below" xml:lang="en-us">In my room on Kent Street I created my
					psychedelic cave. I went to the Army and Navy Store and bought a parachute, a
					big fucker, it would drape an entire ceiling. Then in the middle where there was
					a hole, I tacked it up around the light and draped the sides. The parachute was
					white, so I took four boxes of red dye, put it in the washing machine on hot,
					and when it came out, it was a nice blood red. Then I strung Christmas lights,
					tacked them up along the sides, so my room resembled a big tent. I’d open the
					door and pull the parachute silk up and over. When you went in there, it was
					like being in the womb. It was like a <span class="italic">red cave,</span> a
					safe place .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and the Christmas lights behind the parachute were on
					and blinking and you felt <span class="italic">hmm-hmm</span>. I’d pull the plug
					for the lights out and go to sleep.</p>

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I lived in black orchid oil—that intoxicating
					aroma. It’s now illegal to make it because of how many orchids they have to
					smush to make the oil. At first I got the orchids from a friend, and then in the
					seventies I began to grow orchids myself. It has to be really hot and steamy for
					orchids to thrive, so I always had two vaporizers going in my room. Oh, it was
					sticky sweet and she’s my girl. Everything was wet and dense like the Amazon
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the Matto Grosso.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">That room inspired my singing and writing because
					when I went in there, nothing else existed. I guess normal people can do that
					without creating an Amazonian rain forest in their bedroom. They can go to the
					library and write their essays and stories, bury their face in a book, they’re
					so into it. But I was pretty much so <span class="caps">ADD</span> that I had to
					live in a psychedelic cocoon. Not that I minded distractions from appliances. If
					the TV was on when I was studying, I loved it. And all the kids today, every one
					of them can study with the TV. I look at my daughters Mia and Chelsea and they
					can cram for finals to Pharrell while applying nail polish at the same time.
						<span class="italic">Holy multitasking, Batman!</span> But that orchid-oil
					drenched parachute cave was for me a really safe, warm womb to work in
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a sanctuary so hot and humid, seeds would sprout in there,
					spontaneously evoking the demons I danced with to write my lyrics.</p>

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I spent the hour before the gig looking out the
					window thinking, <span class="italic">My god, what are all those limousines
						doing out there?</span> And then a mad thought came to me: <span
						class="italic">Oh, my god, John Lennon’s here!</span> But of course he
					wasn’t. It was a paper house, which means it was all corporate, all executives.
					People in the business coming to see us. I didn’t know that David Krebs had
					called up record company executives and stirred up a competitive frenzy. Clive
					Davis, the president of Columbia, and Ahmet Ertegun, the head of Atlantic, were
					there to go Monster to Monster. Godzilla vs. Mothra! They all came, so we knew
					that however well we did, there was going to be some serious bidding
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and there was.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I told a couple of jokes, introduced the band, made
					the audience laugh, and we played our set. I couldn’t hear my voice—no
					monitors—so I had to scream out, “You got the love,” over the din of the band.
					But I’d learned how to do that by playing the clubs in New York all those years.
					There was Clive Davis clapping enthusiastically after every song. We’d
					unfortunately run through all our numbers when he shouted, “Encore!”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">We finished the set and ran offstage. Frank came
					running backstage. “Get back up there and play something,” he said, and I said,
					“But we don’t know anything else,” and he said, “Just do a jam!” And I said,
					“Okay, we’ll do a thing called ‘Wit’s Tip,’ ” which was a jam we’d do every
					night at the end of a set .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. something I could get cute with:
					“We’re Aerosmith, ladies and genitals. We’ll be back in fifteen minutes
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and don’t forget to try the beef tips.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Frank goes, “Just tell ’em the name of the song is
					‘We Don’t Want to Fuck You, Lady, We Just Want to Eat Your Sandwiches<span

					just <span class="italic">lost</span> it. After the gig he came backstage and
					said, “You guys were great. You’re going to make it big. And you, son,” he said,

					(Ron Pownall for Aerosmith)</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Aerosmith got signed to Columbia Records in 1972 by
					Clive Davis for $125,000. We stayed up all night celebrating, but we knew that
					just getting a record contract wasn’t the be-all and end-all of our career. When
					we finally woke up and saw what was in it, the smell didn’t seem so sweet. The
					contract said we had to deliver two albums a year—which would be impossible on
					account of the fact that we were out on the road touring nonstop, fast and
					furious, to support the singles the radio stations were playing. That’s the way
					you did it.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="sbdropcap">F</span>rank
					Connally was smart enough—and rich enough—to know that the band needed to go off
					by itself and write without the women around. And he obliged me. The
					motherfucker knew .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he <span class="italic">knew. </span>If Joe
					and I could write songs, we would take the group to a whole other level. And to
					do that we needed to live in a house together, rent a place for two weeks. Let’s
					go.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">First he put us into the Sheraton Manchester, north
					of Boston, and then in a couple of suites at the Hilton near the airport (where
					I wrote the lyrics to “Dream On”), and then in a house in Foxboro, where we
					lived the week before recording the first album. I’d wake up in the morning and
					say, “Tom, let’s go and see if we can play this song.” I’d play a few bars of
					“Dream On” on the piano and say, “Well, what if .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Tom plays these
					notes.” I sang them; he played them and it was fucking perfect .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
						<span class="italic">perfect.</span> That’s where “Dream On” started to come
					together. The other guys followed my piano. I said, “Joe, you play what my right
					hand’s doing. Brad you play the left hand.” When we did that—hello,
					synchronicity!</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">So, the band did go out to Foxboro alone, but
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. there are exceptions to every rule. Joey brought a girl, his
					girlfriend, and one night says to me, “She wants to <span class="italic"
						>do</span> you and you can have her.” And that was the best Christmas
					present Joey ever gave me.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="sbdropcap">W</span>e’d been
					together about two or two and a half years when we got ready to record the first
					album. We were poised to strike. I had nine years of being a hippie behind me,
					smoking pot, going to the Village, reading Ouspensky, and wanting to bust out of
					my own placenta, eggshell, or wherever the fuck I came from.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">When I wrote the music to “Seasons of Wither” I
					grabbed the old acoustic guitar Joey found in the garbage on Beacon Street with
					no strings. I put four strings on it, which is all it would take because it was
					so warped, went to the basement, and tried to find the words to match the scat
					sounds in my head, like automatic writing. The place was a mess, and I moved all
					the shit aside, put a rug down, popped three Tuinals, snorted some blow, sat
					down on the floor, tuned the guitar to that tuning, that special tuning that I
					thought I came up with .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

						smokin’ tea.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“Route 66” was our Stones mantra, a way of finding
					our groove. It was the riff I asked the band to play again and again in the
					basement of <span class="caps">BU</span> to show them what <span class="italic"
						>tight</span> playing meant. When I started rehearsing with the jam band, we
						<span class="italic">jammed</span> as good as anyone, but to survive the
					rock ’n’ roll world, we’d have to write songs and get under the hood
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that’s why I had Aerosmith play that lick from “Route 66” over
					and over and over until we were as tight as a midget’s fist.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">We played it so many times it eventually morphed
					into the melody for “Somebody” on our first album. “One Way Street” was written
					at the piano at 1325 with the rhythm and harp coming from “Midnight Rambler.” On
					“Movin’ Out,” the first song I wrote with Joe, you can hear him quoting Jimi
					Hendrix’s “Voodoo Chile.” He quotes the Beatles and the Stones elsewhere on the
					record. The rhythm of “Write Me” (originally “Bite Me”) came from something Joey
					was playing. But the intro comes from the Beatles “Got to Get You into My Life,”
					because at that point we didn’t know how to write hooks.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“Dream On” was the only song I hadn’t finished by
					the fall of ’72, so I moved to the Hilton at the airport in Boston while we were
					doing sessions at Intermedia Studios for the first album. I just buckled down
					one night and wrote the rest of the lyrics .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and I remember
					reading them back and thinking, “Where did I get that from? It’s strange
					rhymage.” I loved Yma Sumac, the Inca Princess with the staggering five-octave
					voice. “<span class="italic">Look in the mirror, the paaaaasst is
						gounnnnnnnnh.”</span> That’s the Yma Sumac vocal swoop. Singers generally
					don’t go from the bridge to the chorus with a bridge note like that, but it
					worked melodically for me. It’s like the Isley Brothers singing “It’s Your
					Thing,” where after the solo the first line of the verse is sung an octave
					higher, then slides down an octave for the next.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I would sing along with Yma Sumac, that
					eardrum-piercing banshee shriek, beginning in the highest register. She sang
					these strange, otherworldly songs in movies like <span class="italic">Secret of
						the Incas </span>and looked like an over-the-top Hollywood version of an
					Inca queen. Sam, Dave, and Sumac—an inspirational trinity.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">In October 1972 we started work on our first album
					at Intermedia Sound. It took only a couple of weeks to record because we’d been
					playing many of the songs—especially the covers—for over a year. Adrian Barber,
					an English engineer who’d worked with Cream and Vanilla Fudge, produced the
					album. It was recorded on very primitive equipment—sixteen-track to <span
						class="caps">AGFA</span> two-inch oxide tape.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">The band was very uptight. We were so nervous that
					when the red recording light came on we froze. We were scared shitless. I
					changed my voice into the Muppet, Kermit the Frog, to sound more like a blues
						singer<span class="italic">. Kermit Tyler.</span> I would unscrew the
					lightbulbs so no one would know we were recording. One of my favorite things to
					say before we recorded a song was “Play it like you would if no one’s looking,
					guys.” They’d be recording and we’d be so nervous, making mistakes and
					hesitating, and I’d go, “Fuck being nervous! Just play!” We would run through
					the song live a couple of times and then Adrian would shout. “Yes! It’s got
					fire; it’s got the bloody fire!”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">As soon as we’d cut that first song, “Make It,”
					upon listening to playback, I knew we’d nailed it. I’d done “Sun” at some studio
					in New York and all that shit. “Sun” was stiff and forced, but I knew that with
					this band, once we got out of our own way we were going to ace it. And with a
					great guitar player like Joe in the band, if we stayed true to our <span
						class="italic">fuck-all</span> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. everything would sound like
					Aerosmith.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I used an exaggerated black-speak voice on all the
					tracks except “Dream On.” I thought it was really cool. The only problem was,
					nobody knew it was me.<span class="italic"> “Ah say-ng lak dis” </span>because I
					didn’t like my voice and it was early on and I wanted to <span class="italic"
						>put on</span> a little. To this day, some people still come up to me and
					ask, “Who’s that singin’ on the first album?” I was into James Brown and Sly
					Stone and just wanted to sound more <span class="caps">R&amp;B</span>.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“Dream On” deserved strings, but we couldn’t hire
					an orchestra on the kind of budget we had for our first record, so I used a
					Mellotron to fill out the sound. It was like an early sampling device employed
					by the Beatles. I used it to add strings and flutes to “Dream On,” while doing
					lines off my keyboard. I thought the Mellotron would do the trick, coming in on
					the second verse.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">In the end we decided not to use “Major Barbara”
					and did Rufus Thomas’s “Walkin’ the Dog” (via Stones) instead, which was tighter
					than a crab’s ass from doing it in the clubs for so many years. On the first ten
					thousand copies of the album they spelled it “Walkin’ the Dig.” If you happen to
					find a copy, it’s worth about five thousand dollars. You’d figure with all the
					cash and power the labels had, they’d learn how to spell. That, coupled with the
					fact that “Dream On” didn’t come out until after the second album, made me think
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <span class="italic">if things didn’t go down, we wouldn’t go
						up</span>. I believe in life imitating art, but who is art and why is he
					imitating me anyway?</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Of all the songs I wrote on that first album, “One
					Way Street” has some of my favorite lyrics:</p>
				<p class="x1song-first" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">You got a thousand
						boys, you say you need ’em</span></p>
				<p class="x1song-last" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">You take what’s good
						for you and I’ll take my freedom</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">The original title was “Tits in a Crib.” That’s
					what I wanted to call it, but that was forty years ago and things weren’t as
					loose as they are today. I wrote it about this girl I was seeing. I’d talk her
					into coming over because she was such a trip .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. did me sooo good.
					She had a baby, and when she came over she’d bring the kid and his crib, saying,
					“I have no babysitter tonight.” She used to fuck me to death in that crib. The
					line “<span class="italic">You got a thousand boys, you say you need ’em</span>”
					came from where we were living at the time, in Needham, Massachusetts. I’ll do
					anything for a rhyme. I can’t think of that girl’s name now, but god, she was
					the skinniest, cutest little trollop.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">The style of the first album was raw, filled with
					relentless attitude. We were a bunch of boys who had never seen the inside of a
					recording studio. You can practically hear our hearts racing on every track.
					Barber’s atmospheric technique resulted in tracks that were so <span
						class="italic">open</span> you could literally<span class="italic">
						feel</span> the tracks breathing .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it was almost
					transparent.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">We knew the road was where we could conquer. Sure
					it was sex, drugs, and rock ’n’ roll, but we wanted to add one more word to the
					equation .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <span class="italic">gynormous</span>. We needed to get
					to the people, so we did it ourselves. Played every small town and went to every
					station in the fucking country. Sure it’s old school, but it worked.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Aerosmith was all about sex .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. music
					for hot chicks and horny boys. Loud, bone-rattling rock for chopped and
					channeled cars and customized Harleys. If you’re driving along and you hear
					“Movin’ Out” you’re gonna go, “I wanna get the fuck out of here and <span
						class="italic">dance</span>!” Roll the window down and let the world in on
					your little secret. Well, the gist of Aerosmithism is: cars + sex. Booty-shake
					music. We rocked like a bitch. <span class="italic">Creem,</span> April 1973,
					wrote “Aerosmith is as good as coming in your pants at a drive-in at age 12.
					With your little sister’s babysitter calling the action.” Okay, at least
					somebody out there was getting us.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-art-below" xml:lang="en-us">We spent the whole of the 1970s on tour.
					It was just one long endless road trip. We’d stay out on the road for a year and
					a half. The only time we’d come off the road was to record an album. We went out
					with everybody: Mott the Hoople, the Mahavishnu Orchestra, the Kinks. We toured
					the Midwest that debut LP summer in a couple of limos with the two guys from
					Buffalo and Kelly, our new road manager: Robert “Kelly” Kelleher. Our first real
					tour was opening for the Mahavishnu Orchestra. John McLaughlin, in his white
					robes, burning incense. Spreading<span class="italic"> his</span> transcendental
					six-string scent .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. sweet. We opened for the Kinks in the Northeast
					and Midwest; Ray Davies called us Harry Smith, after the hair on Kelly’s back.
					We were opening for bands that were our heroes—Ian Hunter from Mott sang like no
					one else did. Groups that were beginning to fade a bit .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and whose
					audiences we wanted.</p>

					stickered every tollbooth from Boston to NYC to L.A.&nbsp;with our first
					Aerosmith sticker, 1973.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-art-below" xml:lang="en-us">We used to do out-of-town shows with Mott
					the Hoople. We’d make up to five hundred bucks a night, with them. To save on
					getting there, we’d use these bogus <span class="caps">DUSA</span>—Discover
						<span class="caps">USA</span>—tickets that were, like, 50 percent off. You
					were supposed to be a non-American passport-holding tourist to get them, but we
					found this travel agent who helped us out. Then I’d go up to the counter with an
					English accent: “Hallo! We’d like to preboard,” or whatever the fuck it was.
					That’s how we were able to do that.</p>

				<p class="caption-2nd" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="caption-drop-cap">T</span>om,
					1974&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. so I could hold him hostage. Not
					anymore&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; (Steven Tallarico)</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Then we’d come home and play every high school in
					the area and little neighborhood colleges. We’d throw a thousand dollars at the
					athletic fund, and we’d do everything else. And they’d give us the four
					walls—meaning we’d make all the money. It soon became a little status thing:
					“Oh, Aerosmith played at our high school!” And then Wrentham High and then the
					Xavarian Brothers out in Westwood and everybody wanted to have Aerosmith play at
					their school and we pretty much did.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">We did it at our high school, too, and at BC,
					Boston College. At the Q Forum at BC, that was when I knew the band had made it,
					the crowd was so huge and out of control. (Meanwhile, our Father Frank is in the
					hockey team dressing room with Father So-and-So, getting him drunk. Oh, those
					were the days!) Because there were so many people that we were almost afraid to
					go on, we went into the bathroom with a security guard, Johnny O’Toole, outside
					the door. The kids were throwing chairs through the bathroom window and climbing
					in the window! Ripping the back doors off the arena, just blowing the windows
					out of the place, trying to get into this hockey rink, which they did. So we ran
					out of there and went down a hallway. Boston College, 1973. There were so many
					people, a real freak show.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Sometime in ’73 this guy Tony Forgione said, “I’m
					going to open a club”—it was the old Frank and Ike Supermarket where Eric
					Clapton and Joey Kramer had played years ago—and asked us to headline. Al Jakes
					was around, and all those goofy guys from Frank Connally’s old crew in
					Framingham. We had Billy Squire and the Sidewinders open for us. The fire
					department was there and they’d posted a certain capacity. “Here’s how we’re
					going to do it,” I said. “We’re going to fuck ’em up tonight.” When you’ve got
					that many people coming in, you estimate the crowd by the median between three
					clickers. We had three different clickers between us. But the count is always
					jive because someone somewhere is always on the take! When we were doing it,
					we’d count every third person coming in. We stuffed that club. We opened one
					night and the fire department closed us down the next night. The club never
					opened again. And we took all the money! Steamroll.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Elyssa Jerret, who married Joe Perry, remained
					unbelievably gorgeous. Everyone was in love with her. She’d been Chicago
					guitarist Joe Jammer’s girlfriend, had gone to England, worked as a high-fashion
					model, had dinner at Jimmy Page’s house at Pangbourne on Thames .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
					and all that. She felt this patina of über-hipness had rubbed off on her.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">On the road, we played “Dream On” every night. I
					thought that was the song that defined me. But not everyone shared my passion
					for that ballad. Every time we started to play “Dream On,” Elyssa would roll her
					eyes and go, “Oh, fuck! Not <span class="italic">this</span> song again! God!
					Let’s go snort some blow!” She’d make sure I saw her. And all the guys in the
					crew followed her into the bathroom. While she was cutting up lines, it cut me
					to the core—it broke my heart. It was the song that hurled us to wherever we are
					today and beyond. Born somewhere between the red parachute and my dad’s piano,
					that song took this band to places where we could only dream on.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Back in the early days before we’d had a hit on the
					radio, we made our reputation playing live and loud. As an opening act we’d only
					get to play three or four songs, so if we wanted to strut our stuff, slow songs
					weren’t what we’d play. You do the hard and heavy down and dirty to get your
					ya-yas out. Joe didn’t like “Dream On” from the start, didn’t like the way he
					played. He felt we were a hard rock band, and here we were staking our
					reputation on a slow ballad. And to Joe, rock ’n’ roll was all about energy and
					flash. When it was first released in 1973, “Dream On” only made it to 59 in the
					Hot 100 charts. But, you know, the song got bigger and bigger and I got my
						“<span class="italic">taa-daa!</span>” moment. When it got rereleased in
					1975, it went to number 6 in the charts. I got a Grammy for it, but I would
					gladly have traded any gold album just to have my brother love that song. Wait a
					minute, I take that back!</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">The concerts were getting more rowdy and
					outrageous. We opened on August 10, 1973, for Sha Na Na at Suffolk Downs
					racetrack near Boston. Thirty-five thousand kids showed up and got so rowdy they
					had to stop the show. Awright! Now that was more like it.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Aerosmith had been big in Detroit from the
					beginning. We had a loud, flashy, gritty, metallic vibe. <span class="italic"
						>Rolling Stone </span>called us greasers, “Wrench Rock,” which was strange
					because we looked more like medieval troubadours. We were hardly grease
					monkeys—mechanics of ecstasy, maybe. But they did love us in the rust belt
					towns: Toledo, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Detroit. The only part of us that was
					heavy metal was the clang of steel .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the body shop, assembly-line,
					car-based clamor. We’re a people’s band. Judy Carne—the English comic who
					starred in the iconic TV show <span class="italic">Laugh-In</span> and dated Joe
					for a stint in the early seventies—thought we were the voice of the mills and
					the malls. And those working-class towns were the places that embraced us early
					on.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">We had to get out there, however we could, to the
					fans. We knew that the energy we had was contagious, that we would infect the
					whole colony. Evidence that we were getting through came when we started pulling
					Mott the Hoople’s audience. Kids started jumping over the barriers, climbing
					onstage, and grabbing at us. Detroit was the turning point for us. We played
					Cobo Hall three times in ’75. After that, we exploded. There’s a ton of bands
					out there competing for the hearts, minds, and bucks of the sacred rock fan, but
					Aerosmith has managed, for better or worse, to get to the ear (and various other
					organs) of a lot of them.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Still, our core audience was always the Blue
					Army—the hard-core kids from the Midwest. They were the Blue Army because they
					all wore denim jeans; the place was a sea of blue. Just like when you go see
					Jimmy Buffett and his Parrothead contingent .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. look out, it’s Q-Tip
					Nation. Everyone’s fucking gray and they love it. And we all got to ride that
					Aerosmith train to the outer reaches.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Our interest was the same as the kids’: rocking
					out, getting them off .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. getting <span class="italic">us</span>
					off! Like I always inquire, “Was it as good for you as it was for me?” Inspires
					a quick verse .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
