					and said she got offered a part in a movie with Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck.
					And she wasn’t sure if she wanted to take it because it was too commercial. “In
					what way?” I said. Her taste in movie roles was more off-beat and indie, like
						<span class="italic">Stealing Beauty</span> and <span class="italic">That
						Thing You Do, </span>which she had already done. So she says, “In the
					opening scene Bruce Willis is teeing off an oil rig and trying to hit the Green
					Peace boats. And then they go up in space to shoot down an asteroid.” I said,
					“Are you kidding me?” She said, “I think it’s too mainstream and commercial,
					Daddy.” “Take it,” I said. “There’s nothing wrong with being a household name,
					baby.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Meanwhile, <span class="italic">Nine Lives

					around with the finished cassette in my back pocket—felt like a bar of gold. But
					look at the goop around it! We all got sober. Looking back, I think if we’d have
					stayed stoned, the band would never have come back and gotten its grip again. I
					was sober for twelve years. Joe had four. Brad maybe had eight. If he was
					drinking wine, doesn’t matter. Tom, who knows what he was doing? Joey’s the only
					one that stayed sober through the whole thing. He’s the only guy in the band who
					stayed the course.</p>

				<p class="x1bm-art-below" xml:lang="en-us">I wrote “Hole in My Soul” with Desmond
					Child. It’s one of my favorite songs. I came to him with the chorus, then went
					to the band and said, “Tom, what if you played this on a fretless bass?” I asked
					him to please, <span class="italic">please</span> get one. “<span class="italic"
						>There’s a HOLE in my soul that’s been killing me forever</span>
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” What a chorus that is. With every album we ever did, I tried to
					dig out the parts with the other members of the band to perfection. Listen to
					Tom’s bass and Joey’s snare and foot from <span class="italic">Pump</span> on
					up. I pushed the rhythm sections up louder than they’d ever been. I worked on
					parts for Tom that I knew would pop out, and when it came time to mix, I pushed
					those parts out and added 3k to them, so they stuck out like the hard nipples
					that were about to listen to it.</p>

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Ten years prior to making <span class="italic">Nine
						Lives</span> I’d been listening to the sound intro on the THX commercial
					that always plays: “<span class="italic">The audience is listening</span>.” Joe
					had bought this fucking guitar that would tune itself. It was a computerized Les
					Paul or something. So I took the guitar and I <span class="italic"
						>untuned</span> it, all over the fucking planet. I said, “Put that over on
					the left side of the studio,” and he hit the button and it went <span
						class="italic">wwwooowwww</span> trying to retune itself and wound up back
					in the key “Taste of India” started in<span class="italic">.</span> Then I said,
					“Can you control the time it takes to get to the chord .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. slow it
					down?” And he goes, “Oh yeah,” so we slowed it down to this intro, ten seconds,
					and I took that guitar, detuned the whole thing again, and put it over on the
					right side .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. then we did it again and panned it over to the right
					side, and when we played ’em altogether we got this incredible sound that was
					the equivalent of <span class="italic">shuuuu, the audience is listening</span>
					but even better than the commercial THX. Then we added this loop that producer
					Glen Ballard had lying around from Alanis’s <span class="italic">Jagged Little
						Pill</span> and I went, “CAN I USE THAT?” And he said, “It’s yours (if you
					pay for it).” We added a track of this Indian singer, and that’s the music

					was more mysterious than in the day, and I could evoke my demons when no one was
					around to bother me. The only problem was when normal people got up, like our
					producer Glen Ballard, who was also a cowriter on “Pink,” they would expect me
					to go in and do my vocals later that morning, when what I really needed was some
					shut-eye. So most days at the old Marlin, we started recording at about 1:00

					and miscellaneous trackage was still there from the Florida sessions with Glen
					Ballard. I had to scrap all the vocals and start over, which didn’t come easy
					for me. Joe and Tim had talked Sony into thinking the album was jinxed by Glen
					Ballard since Tom, Brad, and Joey hadn’t come to Florida yet. We were neck deep
					in the writing process when Glen hired Steve Ferrone to do the drum tracks. So
					we planned to layer in the guitars once they came down—unlike any other album
					we’d done yet. But no, I’d already sung all the vocals and harmonies to the

					they’d been up all night fixing Joe’s timing on the tracks. Glen had a reason to
					his rhyme and wanted the stuff put to grid and the last thing Joe wanted was to
					be told what to do. Another reason why he had him ousted. The funny thing is,

					around like a woman during pregnancy when I’m working on an album. I don’t
					listen to anyone else’s music, I just want to marinate in my own creativity. A
					song is constructed like a tree—from roots to branches, and when it’s done you
					hope it bears fruit. You need a first verse, next a second verse, then a
					prechorus, which is the titillating foreplay, then the cum shot—the payoff—being
					your chorus line. Then comes the bridge, which should bring you back to the
					chorus line, then <span class="italic">boo-ya</span> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. SCORE! It’s
					outta the park. So satisfying, because that chorus, when it works, epiphanates
					everything you ever thought of in your life (or whatever that song made you

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I think my way of writing songs comes from when I
					first heard hymns and organ music in church when God was still there under the
					pulpit in a box covered with red velvet. I grew up Presbyterian, I’ve walked
					with God all my life; you know, I always said my prayers. The music was so
					profound and stimulating, a cosmic harmony pouring into the soul of the
					congregation. That’s why the organ is so powerful. People hear God in a song
					because music infuses your mind with melody .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it floods your brain
					like the fluid in the placenta. So, in church, hearing those giant organs
					sweetly playing swelling chords and melodic soaring hymns, I just fell into that
					angelic sound. And at home, from age one or two, I was lullabied to sleep with
					the notes of Debussy and Schubert. Looking for God? I did not come here looking
					for God, I brought Her with me.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Diane wrote “I Don’t Want to Miss a Thing,” and
					that song, by the way, has one of the most <span class="italic">brilliant</span>
					front lines ever. If you’re in love and your significant other ever says to you,
					“I could fall asleep just to hear you breathing,” you’re going to drop and give
					her twenty right there on the floor. Or nestle your head in her neck and believe
					that you wouldn’t be able to live the rest of your life without her. We’ve all
					been there, haven’t we?</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Songs are nothing but air and pure emotion, but
					they have intense effects on people’s lives. When people relate passionately to
					a song, all that goes on in their lives gets attached to the song—and the music
					never stops. All they want to do is tell me how that was their wedding song, or
					what they played at their wedding.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">How about the two guys who created the
					BlackBerry—they came up with the idea while smoking pot and listening to “Sweet
					Emotion.” At the Kennedy Honors, a prominent democratic politician told me she
					had made love for the first time listening to “Sweet Emotion.” Half the current
					government of the United States has made love to Joe Perry’s licks.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">John Kalodner introduced me to Diane Warren—it was
					an A&amp;R man’s equation: big band, big money, big really talented
					songwriter—big band needs big hit. I’d written a bunch of things with her
					before. When I was working on “Devil’s Got a New Disguise<span class="italic"
						>,</span>” I went out to her house in Malibu. She has a piano that looks out
					over the ocean and I said, “So, we’re gonna write a song. How do we start?”
					“Well, I’ll play you something.” She played me a couple things, mostly ballady
					and it wasn’t working. That’s when I sat down and carved out that beginning
					piano live and <span class="italic">voilà!</span> “Devil’s Got a New Disguise”
					started to take shape. Some years later, the song was completed.

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“Painted on My Heart” was going to be taken by
					Johnny Hallyday, the French rock star. I gave him the stem mixes, I gave him my
					vocal, but at the last minute he didn’t do it. A stem mix is the basic track.
					You put your vocal on it so the band can play behind it. It’s a little like
					Guitar Hero, where you have the backing tracks and you leave space for the kid
					to play Joe Perry.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="sbdropcap">S</span>ome time
					in 1997 I got a call from Jerry Bruckheimer saying he’d like to put four or five
					Aerosmith songs in an upcoming movie. We were all for it and that’s when John
					Kalodner played me Diane’s “I Don’t Want to Miss a Thing.” Little did I know
					that Kathy Nelson, who was picking the music, would put it in the same Jerry
					Bruckheimer movie, <span class="italic">Armageddon</span>, that Liv was talking
					about.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Okay, let’s get into the what-it-is-ness of Diane
					Warren. Diane had written the song already and got a Celine Dion sing-a-like to
					make a demo. Diane put it on a cassette with her band doing it on synthesizers,
					all done in her studio. I listened to it in the car with John Kalodner and said,
					“It’s fuckin’ great, but where’s the chorus? It’s a hit single without a doubt,
					but there’s no chorus.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">A couple days went by, and Diane comes to the
					Sunset Marquis to my room where there was a grand piano. She sits down and
					starts playing “I Don’t Want to Miss a Thing.” And because of the way she was
					singing it, I finally heard the chorus and I went, “Oh, my god,” and I started
					to tear up. It was just that tonal difference between the Celine Dion wannabe
					version—and the way she sold it—and the way Diane sang it, forget about it. It
					was a perfect example of <span class="italic">it’s the singer, not the
						song.</span> The way she sang <span class="italic">“I don’t want to close my
						eyes” </span>made a believer out of me and the rest is history.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">In Diane’s office, a room that she’s used for the
					last twenty-three years, there’s the same piano, cassettes from thirty years
					ago, and thirty number one singles on the wall. She walks around with that
					little green African parrot on her arm, Buttwing, and never leaves home without
					it. That little fucker will live a hundred years and it’ll be singing “I Don’t
					Want to Miss a Thing” on the space shuttle to Mars. Damn if Buttwing doesn’t get
					there before me!</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“Hey, Diane, everyone’s fucking to your songs,” I
					said. “Do you ever get laid?” She laughed shyly. “I get it,” I said, “you take
					all the angst from not getting it—and put it in a song.” She goes: “You got it!
					I’m just a frustrated romantic.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="sbdropcap">O</span>kay, I

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Or .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. was it the Faustian bargain I

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“That’d be sweet.”</p>

				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="sbdropcap">W</span>e would
					soon get our hit with “I Don’t Want to Miss a Thing”—came out in August 1998,
					stayed number one on <span class="italic">Billboard</span>’s Hot 100 for four
					weeks—but before that happened the price to pay prophesied by the Bitch Goddess
					of <span class="italic">Billboard</span> came horribly true.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">My litany of maladies, misfortunes, and woes began
					in the Year of the Rat. It started out uneventfully enough. The band had a day
					off, we were in the Allegheny Mountains. I called Joe’s room and told him I
					wanted to lease a llama and fill our backpacks with crunchy peanut butter and
					jelly sandwiches, and climb to the top of Pikes Peak. We hiked five miles up.
					Unbeknownst to Joe, I had a copy of “I Don’t Want to Miss a Thing,” the version
					with the strings on it. So I brought my CD player—and <span class="italic"
						>two</span> sets of batteries, because I’m on to Murphy.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">We were on the edge of a cliff. Joe’s sitting on
					top of the mountain eating his sandwich, and I walk off, about a hundred feet
					away. I looked over, found a little place to sit down, and listened to “I Don’t
					Want to Miss a Thing<span class="italic">”</span> under the headphones, with
					that orchestra welling up and me watching eagles soar for the first time in my
					life, and I wept like a baby. And then I knew that we really had something. Just
					like the time I listened to “Love in an Elevator,” going “<span class="italic"
						>Whoops!</span> This is gonna be a hit!” I <span class="italic">knew</span>.
					The crying part of “I Don’t Want to Miss a Thing”—<span class="italic"
						>duh-da-duh-DAHN-N-N!—</span>it was, like, <span class="italic">fuck,</span>
					wait’ll they hear this! Never mind “Is it gonna be?” I don’t want to jinx
					anything, but guess what? I know what’s on the radio—this is <span
						class="italic">better</span>!</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">The first Demon of Excruciating Pain visited me a
					week later. We were on tour in Alaska playing the Sullivan Arena in Anchorage on
					April 29, 1998. We’d never done Alaska, so I said to management, “If that’s the
					only state in America that we haven’t played, we’ve <span class="italic"
						>gotta</span> do it.” So we’re up there in Anchorage, and we’re doin’ “Train
					Kept a-Rollin’.” At the end of the song, during Joey’s drum bit, I do this thing
					where I jump in the air, do a spread eagle split, and at the same time swing my
					scarf-festooned mic stand around. The bottom of the mic stand weighs around four
					pounds, and as I go up in the air I accidentally whack the inside of my left
					knee with it. It’s like hitting your funny bone with a four-pound hammer—your
					knee will go all tingly with electricity, so for a moment you can’t feel your
					leg. And that’s what happened to me. I landed, but because my knee was tingling
					and numb, I didn’t have any sensation in that leg when I hit the stage and the
					ACL in my left knee shredded, ripped right out. Your ACL is a ligament inside
					the knee. Anterior crutiate ligament—it’s what holds your knee on.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">And this happened not in midconcert or midsong but
						<span class="italic">right at the end</span> of the show, “Train Kept
					a-Rollin’, ” our encore song. In other words, I fell down at the conclusion of
					our show, providing an unintended climax. I’m lying there, writhing in pain,
					going, “<span class="italic">Aaaaaaagggh!</span>” No one realizes what’s just
					happened to me. I played it like it was part of the show. And I looked back at
					my tour manager and I mouthed the word <span class="italic"
					>ambulance</span>.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">He went, “What?” He didn’t understand yet. But I
					knew that I’d hurt myself beyond any pain I’d ever felt before. I could tell
					something really bad had happened. The ambulance came, they gave me a shot of
					what I love—I didn’t know what it was, but I could hear the opening line of
					“Strawberry Fields” floating through my head.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">At the hospital, they said, “Here’s what you did:
					you tore your ACL. It’s going to take two weeks for the swelling to go down
					before we can go in arthroscopically to look around and see what the damage is
					and take care of it. Two weeks. And here’s what you’ve got to do: ice it every
					day and get that swelling down.” Fuck! End of the tour. Wrong time to make the
					doughnuts—and right into the video of “I Don’t Want to Miss a Thing.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">After that we went somewhere in the Midwest to do
					the video for <span class="italic">“</span>I Don’t Want to Miss a Thing.” I’m
					still in a cast, packed in ice, and if you watch that video, you’ll see that
					they only shoot me from the waist up—just like Elvis. The director created a
					futuristic scenario using two hundred cones, geodesic shapes and stuff. The
					stylist had Betsey Johnson make me a very freaky coat, as I found out later, out
					of human hair—I instinctively knew what to do with it, so I fucked with it, used
					it as a prop just like I did with the mask at the beginning of <span
						class="italic">“</span>Cryin’<span class="italic">.”</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Right after that video we had a number one single.
					What are the fucking chances? Well, I kinda sorta knew we would. Later that fall
					I ran into the Bitch Goddess of <span class="italic">Billboard </span>at a
					convention in the Bahamas. “What are you looking so glum for, baby?” she asked
					with a crooked smile. “Didn’t you get your number one with a bullet?”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“Are you kidding? That stuff with the ACL, that
					wasn’t funny,” I said.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“Ah, well, honey, we all gotta pay our dues,” said
					she. “And by the way, baby, there just might be a little more of that to come.”
					Before I got a chance to ask her what she meant, she’d vanished.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Got home, had to ice my knee another week before I
					went in for the operation. And when I came out of <span class="italic"
						>that</span> wormhole, it was pretty fucking paralyzing—even though they did
					it arthroscopically. That means they drill a little hole in your knee and go in
					with a scope so they can see inside. They fill the inside of your knee with
					water, then flush it out so they can observe what’s going on in there with a
					miniature camera. On the camera are little scissors and they cut the ends of the
					ACL off—it looks just like spaghetti.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">They take out your torn ACL and put in someone
					else’s; it’s called an allograft. When they take the ligament out of your other
					leg, that’s called an autograft. I said, “Fuck that, pass the cadaver, doc. I’m
					a creature who lives onstage, I need <span class="italic">both</span> legs, and
					I need all the help I can get.” He said, “Well, we got a freezer in the other
					room full of knuckles from people who died, and we can use ligament from one of
					those, because knuckles are like ACLs, they take little blood supply, and you
					don’t have to worry about rejection.” So they cut a ligament from this
					sixteen-year-old kid’s knuckle and used that to replace the ACL in my knee.
					Every night when I say my prayers, I say them twice and I thank that kid who
					gave me the ligament for my knee.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Got home the first day after they screwed my new
					ACL in and iced it. Second day, I get into this machine. You Velcro your foot
					into it, it has a slow-moving motor that moves your foot straight out, and then
					it goes up to a bend while the ice bag is on. It goes <span class="italic"
						>mmmmmmmmmmnnnnnnnnnn,</span> moving your leg up s-l-o-w-l-y and then back
					down. That’s the first two weeks. Did that hurt? Oh, fuck, yeah!</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I was on painkillers, but still .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
					it’s what you have to do to get out—the only way out is through. It took four
					months, but after that I was in pretty good shape. It still hurt, but my knee
					was well enough for me to go on the next Aerosmith tour. We had to go right out,
					because by that time “I Don’t Want to Miss a Thing” was number one, and all
					these opportunities came up. We played Madison Square Garden again.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I brought a girl out on tour with me, she massaged
					me three times a day: iced it, massaged it, iced it. When they massage a scar,
					it goes away. That’s why I don’t have any scars. I wore a leg brace onstage for
					six months after that. When I first got it, it was mummy white. I said, “Paint
					it black!” I cut all my pants off at the knee and it looked pretty cool. Steven,
					the bionic man. We had to tour, so that was that.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="sbdropcap">I</span>n
					December 1998, I went to the White House with the band, and fuck me if President
					Clinton wasn’t being impeached <span class="italic">that day</span>. The Senate
					broke, they called him up, and said, “Mr. President, you’re going to be
					impeached; we’re on our way over.” So all the trucks were there from the news
					media (as you can only imagine). We were all at the Secret Service shop in the
					basement. There’s a firing range down there and a major tunnel with a train
					that’s propelled through a pneumatic tube. You strap yourself in and it goes
						<span class="italic">ptchoooo-oooo!</span> to some DUM (Deep Underground
					Military) facility. America’s full of DUMs. But enough about our managers.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">We’re getting walked around, given little

					“Steven, do me a favor, can you come upstairs, please?” I said, “That’s fine
					with me, but we’re playing tonight.” “What time do you need to be there?” “Six,
					and the gig is three hours away.” “No problem, we’ll get you there.” They took
					us upstairs to a waiting room to hang out till Bill Clinton could come meet us.
					And where do you think they put us? The Situation Room—I’m sitting in the
					president’s chair looking around at all the monitors. We met with Bill
					(briefly—he was kinda busy that day, ya think?). Then we were escorted quietly
					out of the White House. We were walked out to a police escort—off to Quantico,
					FBI headquarters to stroll down a street with full-on machine guns. They let me
					shoot dummies at a practice range there that’s mocked up to look like a city
					block. Animatronic figures pop out at you as you walk around. The head of a
					terrorist leans out and you shoot at it, then an animatronic little girl leans
					out with her doll—ooops!</p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="sbdropcap">“I</span> Don’t
					Want to Miss a Thing” was nominated for an Oscar for best original song—it was
					the theme song for <span class="italic">Armageddon</span>—which was especially
					sweet since Liv was one of the stars of the movie. I was going to perform it at
					the Academy Awards. I peeked through the curtain and looked down and there’s
					Eric Clapton and Sting and Madonna and all the people from my era, sitting in
					the front row. Just before the curtain opened my keyboard player kicked a cord
					out and it took out my ears so I couldn’t hear the mix. When the performance
					starts I’m supposed to be up front with the guy playing the cello for the
					opening line of the song. They went “Sixty seconds!” “But, wait,” I said, “I
					can’t hear anything! Is that mic on?” I walked back to my production man and
					told him, “Don’t let them open the fucking curtain yet, I have no ears. Do not
					open—” They did it anyway. And so the song started and I was twenty feet from
					the cello player. I wasn’t about to <span class="italic">run</span> up to the
					front of the stage; everyone in the place would have laughed, “<span
						class="italic">A-HA-HA-HA!</span> Look at Steven, he lost his mark!” I’m a
					little more professional than that. I walked up <span class="italic">real
						slowly</span>. But by the time I got to the cello player—probably thirty
					feet away—the first verse was gone. I blew the first verse. Live TV at the
					Oscars! Oh, man.</p>

						>W</span>e’d got our number one hit record, been at the Grammys, and still
					had a half-a-Grammy left, sung at the Academy Awards. So I had to go through a
					few rough periods—but it was all worth it. Aerosmith was at full tilt. I was
					happily married to Teresa with two beautiful children, Chelsea and Taj, plus my
					Liv and Mia. Life was good and I had nothing to worry about. Or so I thought.
