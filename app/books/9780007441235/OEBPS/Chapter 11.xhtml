			<p class="x1bm-first" xml:lang='en-us'><span class="dropcap">A</span> day in the life on the road—<span class="italic">Oh yeaaah!</span> The Permanent Vacation Tour’s going to last seven months, easy .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. more likely a year. You wake up, you leave Boston, you’re going on fucking tour, baby. This is the first true (more or less) clean and sober tour, 1989–1990—and Joe and I have gone from the Toxic Twins to the Detox Twins.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>Still, it’s hardly the Goody Two-Shoes Tour, so you’ve got to watch your step when temptation beckons—and trust me, <span class="italic">it beckons</span>. Why the need for caution? Because there’s wives and girlfriends on this tour; you fuck someone, and even if <span class="italic">your </span>wife isn’t on this leg of the trip, you know only too well, one of those bitches will be the first to get on her cell phone to your wife or significant other and tell all. “That Steven! He’s incorrigible! Will he <span class="italic">never</span> grow up?” “My dear, I shouldn’t be telling you this, but .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what <span class="italic">was</span> he doing backstage to that slutty piece of jailbait? The silly boy tried to explain the bizarre pose he’d got himself into—‘She’s interviewing me for her high school newspaper.’ Yeah, <span class="italic">right</span>.”</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>If you’re on tour for a year, you’re not fantasizing about drugs and booze and hot chicks so much as you’re dreaming about falling into a comfortable bed at the end of that endless day. If you stay at the best hotels, then just scrape a million dollars off a tour because that’s what you end up paying for eight guys in the fucking Four Seasons, deal or no. The tour manager is wheeling and dealing so he can stay in there for free because he brought Aerosmith. <span class="italic">A-heh</span>. Oh, yeah!</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>We stopped staying at the Days Inn in 1977 because we’d wake up in the morning with our backs twisted, thinking about feather beds. It was the era of <span class="italic">enough</span>! Plus there were fucking fans next door banging on the wall, <span class="italic">bam-bam-bam-bam-bam!</span> “You’re the fucking BALLS! You’re the FUCKIN’ BALLS!!!” At the Four Seasons you had security, and who gives a shit if it’s a million dollars off the top.</p>
			<p class="x1bm-art-below" xml:lang='en-us'>The best tours are the ones that are propelled by hit singles, like the Pump and Permanent Vacation Tours. <span class="italic">Pump</span> had <span class="italic">“</span>Love in an Elevator” and “Janie’s Got a Gun.”<span class="italic"> Permanent Vacation </span>had “Angel” and “Rag Doll.” So when we went out on tour I knew we were four deep in hits. I knew it, oh, I <span class="italic">so</span> knew it! The tour’s the surfboard, the wave is your popularity, how you’re getting played, and if you are, you’re going to go through the tunnel. It’s a wave from the backside of Hawaii twenty feet tall and you’re riding that fucker as long as you can ride it.</p>

			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>You leave Boston with a wistful heart. “Bye! Uh, we’re going! Sniff!”</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>We’ll be back in Boston in four months, and that’s when the family comes to see the show and they start getting their guest list together: the doctors, the lawyers, and the candlestick makers, the fucking guy that gave me my canoe, the schoolteachers, the pharmacist, the caterer, the manicurist, the yoga teacher.</p>
			<p class="x1bm-art-below" xml:lang='en-us'>You get on the plane, the first gig’s in Dallas. You get to your room, you lay out your clothes. You’re going to stay in Dallas and do that hub thing, so imagine we’re in the middle of a wooden wheel with these big spokes leading to the different cities we’re going to play. We were there for a week, Four Seasons. You wake up the next morning around nine, eat a little something by ten. At eleven you go to the gym, take a shower, you’re back in the room by twelve, get your room in order and have a little lunch. By one, one thirty, there’s a lobby call.</p>
			<p class="art-2" xml:lang='en-us'><span class="generated-style-2"><img class="generated-style-2" src="images/062_fmt.jpeg" alt="062.jpg" /></span></p>
			<p class="captions" xml:lang='en-us'><span class="caption-drop-cap">A</span>nything for a good shot&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;2010. Out of the closet, but still in the drawer. (Erin Brady)</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>Your assistant says, “You know what? I was just downstairs, there are a bunch of people outside, so I talked to the manager, he says we can go to the second floor, we can walk down a set of stairs and go out the back way, <span class="italic">or </span>you can go out front. Either way, there’ll be a car waiting, whatever you choose. There’s about twelve people out front right now.” I know if I want to sign autographs, say hello, and run real quick it’ll take me about six minutes; that’s what I want. Signing autographs for twelve people, you’re talking six minutes, twenty people, ten minutes. But security has to know what I know. What if someone has a gun there? John Lennon got blown away by a psychotic fan. What if? And I walk into those situations all the time. I’ve got five bulletproof vests at home.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>Two o’clock, you’re down in the lobby. You ride back to the airport. Two thirty you get on the plane, a plane you rented—that’s going to cost you another two million dollars by the end of the run, scrape that off the top. You get in that beautiful plane of yours, you claim your seat—mine’s on the right, up in front. I put my pens and papers there and scrawl my initials on the table with a Sharpie. To the left of me is a five-foot bench along the side of the plane. There’s one seat across from me where my significant other will sit. Joe is to my left, and then Joey, Brad, and Tom are back there behind me. It’s a ten-seater: five of us plus tour manager, security, the stewardess, girlfriends, etc. Stuff it all in, luggage stowed, we leave at three and head off to the first venue.The tour manager books it so we fly for an hour; sometimes it’s an hour and a half, sometimes two, but not often. Generally an hour and fifteen minutes. It’s the tour manager’s job to set a tour up around a hub. You’re flying at four hundred miles an hour. An hour and a half gets you to, say, Omaha.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>You get out of the plane at four thirty. At the FBO (Flight Base Operations), you ask if there’s a bathroom. You hope that your tour manager has enough brains to have called ahead and checked this out. We don’t get in the cars and go right away—we take five to ten minutes, say hello to the cops, talk about <span class="italic">guns, </span>the tour manager can talk to the guy at the venue. “Do you have a shower there?” No. Okay, now you have to figure out some other way to take a shower before the show. As you’re leaving the airport, you see a motel. The tour manager says, “Hold on!” and you pull the motorcade over. You stop at the motel and say, “Look, can we get a day room?”</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>By five o’clock you’re in your dressing room at the venue. The place holds twenty thousand people. You’re ready for tonight. You shoot the shit and bullshit for a while. It’s six o’clock, time for your meet ’n’ greet, shaking hands with people from the radio station, fans who have won tickets by being the fifth caller or the dude looks like a lady or whatever they do to get their tickets. They’re all there in the room with you, asking you questions they already know the answers to. Backstage nepotism runs wild. Deejays and their kin. It’s the announcer, it’s the morning jock, it’s the nighttime jock, it’s the five jocks gacked on coffee in the morning, the morning-show guys, the night show, the five o’clock sideshow—they’re all there with their wives and their best friends—so it’s a room full of fifty to sixty people. You meet ’n’ greet till seven. Around seven you ask the girls that do the backstage, “What time’r we goin’ on?” “Nine fifteen!” I have to eat two hours before I go onstage, so at seven o’clock I get the cook to come in. He makes me salmon. I have salmon every night—it’s got to be <span class="italic">wild—</span>and steamed broccoli. I eat that at seven, I’m done by seven thirty or so.</p>
			<p class="x1bm-art-below" xml:lang='en-us'>People are still walking in and out, guys from the opening band. Shooting the shit with Kid Rock. “Where’s your girlfriend?” Pamela Anderson comes walking in, “How goes it?” I said. I remember the first time I saw her at the MTV Europe Music Awards at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin. She was going out with that guy in Poison, Bret Michaels. She was hot so I lied and said, “What the fuck are you doin’ with that jerk, you knew I was going to be here.” So <span class="italic">pretentious,</span> so <span class="italic">rock star,</span> but then again I’d drink a gallon of her piss just to see where it comes from.</p>
			<p class="art-1" xml:lang='en-us'><span class="generated-style-2"><img class="generated-style-2" src="images/49_fmt.jpeg" alt="49.jpg" /></span></p>
			<p class="captions" xml:lang='en-us'><span class="caption-drop-cap">B</span>ackstage with the gorgeous Pamela Anderson in Detroit, 2007. (Gene Kirkland for Aerosmith)</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>It’s now, like, seven thirty, my assistant goes, “ST” and she points to her watch. “Come on!” Nine fifteen we go on, so eight o’clock’s the lockdown in the dressing room, lock it out, no one comes in. I set my timer for an hour—when it stops, it goes <span class="italic">Brrr-RRRR-rrrr-RRRR-rrrr-RRRRRR!</span> It’s my fucking time, because I can’t keep time to save my life. Pamela comes in again. We’re shooting the shit! Some people are still pulling on me, going, “Steven!” I sit down and do makeup. Makeup takes twenty minutes. Hair I do myself. After that I do a little exercising, get on my StretchMate, get on the floor and do a little yoga, stretch those muscles out—if I don’t, I know I’m going to feel it later on. Work out with my twenty-pound weights on my board. Now it’s getting around eight fifteen and I’ve gotta warm up, singing, so it’s <span class="italic">Ay-aay E-eeee I-iiiii O-oooo Ay-aay E-eeee I-iiiii O-oooo Ewwww Ay-aay E-eeee I-iiiii O-oooo Ay-aay E-eeee I-iiiii O-oooo, </span>all the way up to the top, so you can’t go any further, then all the way down to the bottom. Just watch that episode of <span class="italic">Two and a Half Men</span> and you’ll know what I do. I’m the one the guy next door is complaining about when I practice my scales.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>Then I get the countdown—they call out to me to give me the time I have left till I have to go on: “Fifteen minutes!” That’s when I first get that “<span class="italic">Oh, shit!</span> I gotta go onstage!” jolt. Any bug that I got flies out of my body ’cause it knows deep down inside it’s going to be two hours of <span class="italic">insanity.</span> I’m throwing a party for twenty thousand people. I <span class="italic">love</span> it, I’m addicted to adrenaline. “Five minutes!” someone calls out. We walk down the side of the stage and the tape rolls—it’s a five-minute film. I got my big burly friend K. C. Tibo and his wife to take pictures of us that we could project on the screens in the back during the show. K.C. made an Aerosmith film with a voice-over in the style of the old newsreels: “And defending the nation is. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” We found the reporter that used to do them, got his voice, and put it on the tape. It shows us at various places on tour. “And we stopped in Berlin!” We could be in Berlin on the European tour, we could be in Prague, we’re going to France. It’s projected behind us on an LED screen.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>The LED screen is forty by sixty feet. When you hear LED you think a flat screen, but this thing is five inches thick. It’s set up every night, hi-def Aerosmith. We used to have a camera showing us coming out of our dressing room and walking up to the stage. <span class="italic">Bor-ing!</span> Been there, done that. Not cool. This new montage of scenes K.C. came up with out of his head—he’s brilliant, great cinematographer. He did the whole European tour with us, but because he stayed with me and filmed me, some people in the band got a little jealous and knew that I was doing a movie. If I die, K.C. has explicit orders to make all these clips into a movie and put the thing out, so the world can see what goes on with me.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>My ex-wife Teresa is there, my girlfriend Erin is there in the dressing room. Dan Neer is interviewing me on a boom for XM Radio, I’m getting my face done by the makeup girl, the pitcher from the Red Sox is there with his wife. There I am ogling girls, philosophizing, chewing people out, hanging out with the Make-A-Wish Foundation kids. I go around the corner real quick because I have to pee. Dan says, “Do you mind if I come?” I haven’t warmed up yet, and my cell phone rings, it’s Al Gore! So there’s all this stuff going on while I’m taking a leak. I tell the makeup girl, “You can look if you want.” When you’re not married, there’s all sorts of things you can do, stuff I could never do when my wife was around. I can’t <span class="italic">tell</span> you what <span class="italic">joy</span> that is. Because with wives you can’t joke! That’s part of the bargain. It’s all on film, a day in the life. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>Curtain drops, Aerosmith’s on, two-hour show. The show takes us from nine fifteen to eleven fifteen. We’re supposed to be off at eleven fifteen—that’s a state curfew. If we go over it, we gotta pay them a couple of thousand dollars a <span class="italic">minute;</span> sometimes it’s <span class="italic">five thousand</span> <span class="italic">dollars a minute</span> if you’re in New York at Madison Square Garden; it’s ten thousand dollars every five minutes in L.A. And we <span class="italic">always</span> go over it. Makes you wonder what Axl Rose paid on his tour. Okay, so we get offstage at eleven, eleven fifteen, an hour backstage taking showers, meeting people, talking to girls, twelve thirty we’re at the plane, we fly back, an hour-and-a-half flight.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>Like they say, the woman has to be in the mood, the guy just has to be in the room—and that—being in the mood—goes for the lead singer, too. You have to get it up, you have to get up there onstage and flaunt your petals. (You’re asking yourself, <span class="italic">What is he saying? Where is he going with this? Is he on drugs again? Better call Tim Collins</span>.) Onstage, who takes the brunt in Aerosmith? ME! When your audience doesn’t respond to a song, who feels worse about it, who owns it the most, the guitar player or the lead singer? No wonder I got Lead Singer Disorder.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>And what is the leading cause of LSD? Guitar players! They drive lead singers crazy! Guitar players can put their amps on 10 and have a roadie change their strings.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>Thank you! Onstage, no one’s going to hear if Joe’s guitar is out of tune—it’s been out for years, it was out for most of the seventies. Now we have really good guitar techs. Still, it slips. Stuff happens. Joe plays so hard, his guitar still goes out of tune. I always wondered, <span class="italic">Is it just me? How come only I notice it?</span> It bothers the hell out of me onstage, but the audience doesn’t hear a thing. They’re stuck on the image of Joe being there, the cool cat they saw on the back of the album. Oh my god, it’s <span class="italic">him</span> and it’s live and <span class="italic">there he is</span>! Steven Tyler—live and in person. Well, I got news for ya, if I for a second sang flat <span class="italic">“I could lie awake just to hear you </span>breathin<span class="italic">’,”</span> Oh, whoops! In the press, in the paper: “His voice was all right, but he kind of missed a couple notes.” And they would put their finger on what note it was. “Steven Tyler looks good, but his voice is slipping. Maybe old age and years of drugs, maybe drug rehab—” Oh, they’ll look for anything! They speculate like crazy. That’s why, in my Italian mind, that lawn’s got to be mowed and good. It’s got to be raked—or I ain’t going to the beach! So if I don’t sing really good and be all I can be in the Aero Army (ha-ha) they’ll be on my case like white on rice.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>You’re in a band, you make it, you’re let in the door; then you have to be realer than the realest real for people to relate to when fans are standing on their feet for three hours to come see you. They need to see a show that evokes something extreme in them. So you’ve got to, telepathically, and through body language and song, <span class="italic">reach</span> them profoundly, visually, electrically, do something that changes their Everything. The song you sang once touched something in their life, something that they can totally relate to. They heard you first on the radio <span class="italic">without</span> seeing you; now they’re one-on-one with you by being there.</p>
			<p class="x1bm-art-below" xml:lang='en-us'>We’re onstage, and during the last song, I hear in my ears, “Steven, we’re doing a runner, the cops are waiting, go right to the car, stage left, stage left.” We run out that way. That’s when you put on the bulletproof vest, when you hear that goofy cartoony voice saying, “<span class="italic">Ex-it staaage left.</span>” I snap into the vest, I’m so hot and just, like, <span class="italic">hoo-hah-hoo-hah</span>. I need to sit in the car in just my underwear and a towel with Erin. She gives me a little something to drink, we get in a police motorcade, the police siren goes off, <span class="italic">BaroooOOOOOOoooooOOOOOOoooooo! </span>It’s <span class="italic">so</span> loud! The noise! Trying to talk over the noise of the police siren, the plane’s engines on the runway.</p>
			<p class="art-1" xml:lang='en-us'><span class="generated-style-2"><img class="generated-style-2" src="images/50_fmt.jpeg" alt="50.jpg" /></span></p>
			<p class="captions" xml:lang='en-us'><span class="caption-drop-cap">A</span> quiet moment with Erin before the storm of the next show, 2006. (Melissa Mahoney © Steven Tallarico)</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>Around twelve thirty we’re back on the plane. The pilot’s complaining because he’s got to fly so much—and we just came offstage! I guess it’s all relative, because we all think our problem is the worst until we see someone else’s. I’m bitching because I’ve been onstage for two hours and I hurt. Meanwhile somebody else was building the fucking pyramids.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>The next morning, you don’t have a show that night, but you’re fucking dragging your ass. How do you fix a sore back? Back in the gym. You got to stretch that shit out. I learned that early on. But no jogging—those guys that run every morning have fucked-up knees and legs and feet—just like I do from working out onstage for thirty years. We wear out, and that’s a secret that nobody knows. The best exercise for anybody is keeping your hand away from your mouth—food is kind of a drug addiction itself. I did drugs because it made me feel good, beginning, middle, end of story. People eat because they got a lot of time on their hands and want to satiate the body. It’s fucking great, I love to eat! Being off the road now, I love to eat, but I can’t just indulge.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>Two o’clock we’re back in Dallas. Two thirty, we’re dragging our fucking sorry asses into the lobby. What time did we leave? C’mon, try and keep up! It’s a twelve-and-a-half-hour day. I first noticed that about seven years ago. I always just took it for granted, “Ah, it’s three o’clock! We’ve gotta get to bed!” We never do two days in a row. In the past my throat was ripped, and after years of that I finally went, “You guys, fuck you. I’m doing day-on, day-off and I don’t care how much money you think we’re losing, that’s what I need for my voice.” Joe’s guitar tech takes his sorry-ass worn-out guitar and strings, changes them, sets the guitar up for the next date. I don’t have anyone to change my strings.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>Three o’clock, I fall onto my comfortable bed at the Four Seasons and go to sleep. Nine o’clock my alarm goes off, I get up, order breakfast, go to the gym. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And that’s my life.</p>
