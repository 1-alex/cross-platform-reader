					<br />Hemingway</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm-first" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="dropcap">C</span>al Jam II was
					held at the Ontario Motor Speedway, sixty miles east of L.A., on March 18, 1978.
					It was the biggest gig Aerosmith ever did. The thing was Woodstock <span
						class="italic">huge</span>. Half a million people if you include the
					crashers. I knew we were to make history when I looked down from the helicopter
					five hundred feet up in the air and I couldn’t see land—just a sea of people on
					a two-and-a-half-mile oval track. A small town. Evel Knievel’s company painted
					all the vans that we used to get from the hotel to backstage with the <span
						class="italic">Draw the Line</span> album cover on the sides.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">We were spread out all over the place. The band was
					at the Beverly Hills Hotel, the crew was at the Hyatt House, and stagehands were
					at motels in Ontario. But when we all met in the middle—which was the stage—we
					were like the United Mistakes of America. Powerful, free, and fucked-up. By
					day’s end, there were seven hundred ODs on angel dust, one rape, and two dozen
					robberies. Two babies were born the night we played, during what song I’m not
					sure, but strangely enough, they both resembled Joey Kramer.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">We headlined the festival with the top rockers of
					the day .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Bob Welsh, Dave Mason, Santana, Heart, Ted Nugent,
					Foreigner, and Mahogany Rush. We’d observed that if you knew what time the sun
					went down and it wasn’t cloudy, as the sky got darker, your lights onstage got
					brighter and more magical as the set went on. If you played it right—and threw
					in great songs to go along with God’s light show—it was like nothing short of a
					deity showing up at your gig. All the nuances that a lighting director could
					never get, that movie crews wait for all day. They call it the “magic hour.” We
					called ours the “witching hour.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">So let’s for a moment talk about the Scam at Cal
					Jam. Here I was, waxing on about Mother Nature’s klieg lights, when Murphy’s Law
					comes along and says, “Hey, Steve, what a great idea. Do you mind if I fuck it
					up for you?” Ted Nugent has to have an encore; Foreigner gets two. And don’t
					forget Santana—he gets an encore, too. So by the time Aerosmith got onstage, it
					was 12:08, eight minutes into the next day. It was so late, even God had left.
					And the next day a far worse fate befell us—Kelly, having tried to snort every
					spec of blow at Cal Jam, left Aerosmith.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="sbdropcap">R</span>ewind to
					1977, Aerosmith goes Hollywood!! “They’re gonna put me in the movies, they’re
					gonna make a big star out of WE.” Thanks, Ringo .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I mean, Buck.
					The movie was <span class="italic">Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band.</span>
					To be involved in ANYTHING that was slightly related to the Beatles was a dream
					come true. But with us, dreams were never quite what they seemed—they were
					either wet or a nightmare.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“We’ll do it!” I said. Then I read the script. And
					here it comes: I get killed at the end? And by Frampton?</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I talked with the film’s producer, Robert Stigwood,
					in his office and had to put on my skis just to get to his desk. After three
					hours of me telling him “I’m not gonna be Framptonized,” they blew smoke up my
					ass by telling me I wouldn’t die in the movie. They would set my clothes on fire
					and I’d melt like the Wicked Witch of the West. That was how it was supposed to
					be.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">The most fun I had doing the movie was when I was
					strangling Strawberry Fields (played by Sandy Farina) with my microphone scarves
					and she kicked me off the stage and watched me plummet thirty feet into an
					airbag. Of course I had to do it twenty times .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. just for shits and
					giggles, ’cause I loved it. Not to mention, as I fell, I could see up
					Strawberry’s shortcake.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">The movie was a Hindenberg at the box office. Wait,
					the dream come true I left out .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is I got to meet George Martin.
					We talked about recording “Come Together” at the Record Plant .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
					fifteen minutes about the track and fifteen hours about the Beatles. He said he
					loved our band and was looking forward to working with us in the studio. We did
					a badass version of the song. I would have believed anything George Martin said.
					However, he wasn’t just charming, he was brilliant and beautiful. I could see
					all that in his eyes. And I must admit that when I was singing the first verse
					of “Come Together” and I looked through the glass at Studio A, Record Plant
					east, it was like for that one nanosecond in time .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I was
					John.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">In 1978, still waiting for Cyrinda to surrender, I
					was dating Gretchen, a wild blond mama who later on married one of the guys in
					Blue Öyster Cult. She was feral and perpetually aroused<span class="italic">.
					</span>She would have at it with herself and me in the back of the limo, which
					shocked even Rabbit, who was pretty unshockable (and by the way, fucked like the
					critter that inspired his name). There was a party for the <span class="italic"
						>Sgt. Pepper </span>film at Studio 54. Ray and his ex-wife Susan were there
					and at one point Susan came over to Ray and me and said, “You’re not going to
					believe this, but Steven’s girlfriend, Gretchen, is flashing her cooha in front
					of everybody.” I said, “What the hell are you talking about?” She said, “Yeah,
					she’s walking around with her dress up, and she’s flashing her fish kitten in
					everybody’s face.” I couldn’t believe it. I went over and confronted Gretchen.
					She flat out denied it. Gretchen called Susan out. The “fuck you’s” went back
					and forth like Connors and McEnroe at Wimbledon. Meanwhile, Susan’s brother,
					Richard Sanders—who started working for Aerosmith and wound up running his own
					record label—showed up with a copy of a magazine from the East Village, with a
					picture of Gretchen—GUESS WHAT?—with her dress up! When I saw that I was so
					pissed off at her that I broke up with her. You know, looking back on that, I
					can’t believe I left because of her flashing .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. when here I am,
					humping Joe’s monitor during “Back in the Saddle” every night.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Outside Studio 54, there was such a mob waiting to
					get in .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that I jumped up on Kelly’s back and rode him to the
					limo. The paparazzi were flashing their asses off, and a month later the
					quasi-photo was there with a caption that read, “Being rich means never having
					to walk again.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">This kind of story seeps into the Aerosmithsonyian.
					You know you’ve made it when all your friends have the same story, which goes:
					“I carried him out .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <span class="italic">No, I carried him out!
						No, </span>we<span class="italic"> carried him out! Nooooo .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
						wait a minute! He carried us out. Paid for our drinks and nailed us all in
						the ladies’ bathroom</span>!” Such was the life at Studio 54.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="sbdropcap">C</span>yrinda
					and I got married on September 1, 1978, at the summit of Trow Hill in Sunapee,
					after dating for a year. We trudged over the river and through the woods through
					blueberry wishes to the very top of the mountain. We were up so high that the
					altitude got us straight. Zunk Buker—the pilot for the plane I owned—had a
					brother who happened to be a priest. We said our nups, gasped our “I do’s,” and
					hightailed it over to King Ridge ski lodge in New London. The reception was
					fairy-tale perfect. Lilacs and gardenias hung from the rafters as my dad played
					romantic music from the 1940s. The food, my family, my friends—I’d never kissed
					so many women with mustaches. The Italian and Armenian cultural collision was a
					success and the honeymoon had already begun.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-art-below" xml:lang="en-us">I’d bought a house the year before and a
					piece of property right on the lake in Sunapee. On that heavenly body of water,
					I fell so deeply in love with Cyrinda, I felt for the first time in my life that
					all my dreams had come true. Three days before Christmas 1978, our beautiful
					daughter, Mia, was born. I could have wished for nothing more in life.</p>
				<p class="art-2" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="generated-style-2"><img

				<p class="captions" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="sbdropcap">J</span>ust married, me
					and my beautiful wife, Cyrinda Foxe, 1978. Mia and I lost her on September 7,
					2002. (Aerosmith)</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">The winter before we married, I’d taken her up to
					the family digs at Trow-Rico. Got in the Willys Jeep and drove her down to the
					lake to show off and show her the house. It was ten below and the lake was
					frozen solid. I headed for Sunapee Harbor and drove right off the dock and onto
					the ice. It was dusk and almost dark. A half a mile out into the middle of the
					frozen lake, Cyrinda’s screaming like she was on the <span class="italic"
						>Titanic</span> and it was going down. I spun the Jeep around five times and
					headed for the shore. When we pulled up in front of the house, I turned on the
					headlights, and when she saw the house sitting on the water like a Christmas
					card, she started to cry<span class="italic">.</span></p>
				<p class="x1song-first" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">She was a city
						girl</span></p>
				<p class="x1song-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">With no
						responsibility</span></p>
				<p class="x1song-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">A pretty little city
						girl</span></p>
				<p class="x1song-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">All fired up and
						what’s</span></p>
				<p class="x1song-last" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">Ah what that girl could
						to do me</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">We sat there till the battery went dead, and I said
					to her, “This will be our house.” Then <span class="italic">I</span> cried.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I know there have been (and I’m sure there will be)
					more books written about me—from Stephen Davis’s <span class="italic">Walk This
						Way</span> to Bebe Buell’s <span class="italic">Rebel Heart</span> to
					Cyrinda Foxe’s <span class="italic">Dream On </span>and Joey Kramer’s <span
						class="italic">Hit Hard</span>. Sometimes I feel compelled to read parts of
					these memoirs so I can remember things about me that I don’t remember. But on
					occasion when I read on, I find stories that are so outrageously absurd and
					blown out of proportion for their own benefit and some insulated truth, I have
					trouble believing these people ever really blew me .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. oops, I mean
					knew ME at all. Now I’m not saying that I’m a saint, but I do know some things.
					And the <span class="italic">me</span> that I ain’t! Probably when I finish
					writing my memoirs, there will be a million and nine people saying, “I didn’t
					say that! I never did that! <span class="hilite-he-s-crazy">He’s crazy!</span>
					He used me! He abused me!<span class="hilite-i-love-him"> I love him!</span>
					<span class="hilite-i-hate-him-bigger-bold">I hate him!</span> And I wonder if
					he could loan me some money!” (No wonder Hemingway drank.) In a book, if you
					want the truth .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. read between the lines! And in music, it dances
					between the notes.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Cyrinda wrote a ton of fuckin’ things about me—some
					of which were true, and some of which were lies and kvetching .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
					nothing in there that said, “I grew up selling drugs on the beach (I don’t know
					what I was thinking) .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. my mom had sixteen boyfriends and I wound
					up in a closet crying till I found speed and I shot up.” That’s what’s too bad.
					But I’d be the first to admit that I would not be who I am without the good, the
					bad, and the ugly.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="sbdropcap">T</span>hose
					were the sweetest and the roughest years of remembrance as far I’m concerned:
					1977 to 1979. By late ’78 the band had begun to disintegrate. Joe and I were
					fighting more and more. We fought backstage, we fought on the plane
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we even fought <span class="italic">on</span>stage, like good
					brothers from the Everlys to the Kinks to Oasis. Joe could torment me to death
					by being so stoned and looking so good. But most of all by playing his guitar on
					fucking 12. He’d play so loud, even Helen Keller could sing along
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. so loud, in fact, that in order to hear myself, I had to STICK
					MY FINGER in my ear. Making me so angry, I wanted to SHOVE MY FIST up his ass.
					From Freddie Mercury to Rod Stewart, they’d all agree that it’s just how we’d
					want to be seen. On the cover of <span class="italic">Rolling Stone
						.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. </span>with our middle finger in our earhole. FUCK ME!
					That’s why God created monitors, In-Ears, and acoustic guitar players. Thank
					you, Crosby, Stills and Nashville. LS fucking D .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ? In-Deed.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">A little-known secret about lead singers with LSD:
					our disorder comes mainly from not being able to hear ourselves. My job is to
					sing dis thing called the melody. So in ORDER to sing the melody, I NEED TO HEAR
					MYSELF sing it.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">So then I’d wait and go over and push him around
					while he was playing, and he would hit me with his guitar. The scuffles didn’t
					start intentionally, but once we got into it, they became an excuse. “You tried
					to fucking hit me, you fuck.” If I got too close and Joe thought I was upstaging
					him, that’s when the games began. Then he’d really try to do it back to me. But
					you can’t reason with somebody when they’re that drunk or high—we would play
					games. I remember once coming really close to punching Joe, but I’m not that
					kind of a guy, I don’t punch people. I never even understood the concept of
					that. Joe and I really did come close to it a few times—three or four times
					maybe—but we never <span class="italic">deliberately</span> hit each other. One
					time Joe stuck the end of a guitar string through my lower lip. I spat blood all
					over him and ended up with a little hole in my cheek. I honestly don’t know if
					he did it on purpose or not. You’d have to ask him on his deathbed. Who knows if
					he’d even tell you then?</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">There were times when Joe was not in the best of
					shape. He would run behind the drum riser when he’d have to sing harmony with
					Henry—which, with Joe, isn’t an easy thing to do. You have to watch Joe’s mouth
					and try and figure out what words were going to come out. Sometimes he’d just
					make up words; sometimes they weren’t even words. Like anybody who sings the
					same words day after day, month after month, he’d get tired of singing the same
					old shit. Or a thought would come into his head while he’s singing and he’d just
					spit out a wordlike <span class="italic">sound</span>.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Somewhere there’s a picture of a firecracker going
					off at the exact moment it hit the stage. A fan mailed the photo in. The flash
					was going off right between Joe and me at the exact second the M-80 blew up. It
					was as we were just coming back onto the stage for the encore. I got a singed
					cornea from that one and Joe cut his hand. The wound on Joe’s hand was the shape
					of a smile, so Joe drew a face on his hand and he would wiggle it and make it
					talk. There was the smashed glass bottle at the Spectrum in 1978, which stopped
					the show. Fans get excited, they get demented. They don’t believe we’re entirely
					human and do this stuff to find out if we bleed the same way they would. One
					time we found a <span class="italic">shuriken</span>—a fucking ninja throwing
					star—on the stage.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">These are war stories. When you’re on tour, short
					of loss of life and limb—or actual death—you have no time to get sick like a
					normal person. There are no days off. You’re working yourself to death. The only
					thing that got us through was the cocaine.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">For the whole of the seventies we were all nicely
					fucked-up and deep-fried. There’s a photo of me somewhere snorting a huge rail
					of blow off a picture of myself in a Japanese magazine. What a great way to get
					high; I snorted my own face.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Blow was our rocket fuel. In the end it takes you
					down, but it’s probably one of the reasons we got as far as we did. We never
					stopped. We would just blaze through it and fall apart when we got home. You’re
					going home, you hit the ground, your mind tells your body what to do. It knows
					it’s off duty and then chooses to get sick. Bands just don’t get sick on the
					road in general—you’re not allowed to.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">After a while our off-tour lives became “At Home
					with the Draculas.” We were zombied out on Tuinals and smack. Kelly used to send
					the security guards to wake us up, one to Joe’s house, one to mine. Knock on our
					doors and if we didn’t answer break them down. If we’d been up all night or up
					all week, okay, go in. If there’s no clean clothes, scoop up all the ones on the
					floor, throw them into a bag, throw us over their shoulders, and put us into the
					limos and out to the airport .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that’s how we used to get Joe and
					me on the road in the bad old days.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Kelly’d be out there at the airport waiting. “Oh,
					shit! Where are they now? I don’t see them on the horizon!” One time when Henry
					was trying to delay the flight, he told the rest of the crew, “Look, do whatever
					you’ve got to do .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. start a fight, tell them there’s a bomb on the
					plane, anything you’ve got to do, because the band’s not here yet and this is
					the last flight leaving today” for wherever we were going.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">All the ticket agent heard was the word <span
						class="italic">bomb</span> and he alerted the authorities. We all get on the
					plane and the door closes. Henry had an ounce of blow on him. It was Allegheny
					Airlines—they used to have tables on their planes, and we were just about to
					move up to the front and do the blow on the table. We would snort blow right in
					front of people back then because no one knew what it was yet. But just then the
					plane door opens again and airport security, FBI, CIA, everybody else with a
					badge in the world comes on the plane with this ticket agent and hauls Henry off
					the plane. Henry also happened to have a suitcase with an ounce of pot in it.
					Kelly claimed it was his and they never searched it.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">They took Henry into custody. The day he went to
					court we had the band’s lawyer, Norman Jacobs, there to represent him. Henry
					shows up in court early in the morning. The judge looks down at the docket, he’s
					going down the list of cases, and when he comes to Henry’s he goes, “Case is
					dismissed.” Turns out the cop who was in charge of the case got shot the night
					before. He was murdered by a Harvard football player. For a while Henry looked
					like a desperado who’d had this cop knocked off so he wouldn’t go to jail.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">By 1978 we’d gone from being nobodies to being a
					multiplatinum band with four albums in the space of three years. We’d played to
					as many as half a million people at one time. And we had addictions to match. In
					the early days we were seen as cash cows—we were worked to death. We did three
					shows a week, and we were kept going on blow. Do you know what a treadmill is?
					Well, we spent the whole of the 1970s on one. It was
					tour—album—tour—album—tour—album. No breaks. Everybody knew what we were doing,
					and we were a mess. No one ever said, “You guys had better take a break.” I was
					having seizures and passing out on stage. At any time I could’ve had a heart
					attack, and people would’ve looked away and said, “Well, we didn’t know what
					they were doing.” Bullshit! There was so much money floating around that no one
					cared.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">The promoters at our concerts were awash in cash;
					they had trunks full of money. We sold tickets like crazy. As a present, our
					accountants framed all the tickets we sold. We must have grossed at least 140
					mil, but the members of the band ended up walking away with no more than 3 mil
					each. I have no hard feelings, but may they roll over in their graves a billion
					million years from now! That’s all I have to say. I look back and I think, “God,
					man, all we were doing was writing songs, making records, touring.” I have a
					pirate’s chest of horror stories of things they’ve done to my brethren and my
					band. Unconscionable shit! I look back at that and, in front of Jesus Christ
					above at Heaven’s Gate, I say, “Thank you and fuck you!”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">All our tours had official names—and <span
						class="italic">our</span> names for them. The Aerosmith Express Tour became
					the WTB Tour—for Where’s the Blow? But as things got worse the crew began giving
					dire names to the tours: the <span class="italic">Grab Your Ankles</span> tour,
					the <span class="italic">Lick the Boots That Kick You </span>tour<span
						class="italic">.</span> Kelly made up a T-shirt with “Why Can’t I Fart
					Anymore?” on it—meaning we’d all been royally fucked in the ass.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">By the time we got to late ’78 we were all a little
					burned. And things started to go awry. We were so fried, we could hear our
					synapses crackling when we went to sleep. The band fell apart when the crew fell
					apart. The crew fell apart first and then the band began to unravel. The core
					rock road dogs began slobbering and howling at the moon. The crew had everything
					to do with keeping us together. Everyone knew everyone’s personalities and how
					we functioned in our own quirky, dysfunctional way. The sky darkened and we
					prayed for rain but no rain came—it just all worsened. We were a complex mix of
					utterly unreasonable people, and the momentum revolved around Kelly, who had
					left after Cal Jam. That’s when I began to wonder, <span class="italic">Why does
						my house have wheels and my car doesn’t?</span> Aerosmith’s core
					group—Kelly, Rabbit, Henry, Night Bob—kept the band rolling during those crazy
					times. Rabbit left in ’78 and Henry left in 1980.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">The roadies started leaving Aerosmith’s
					interstellar probe like rats leaving a sinking ship. Henry Smith said he had to
					leave the band to keep being friends. Night Bob left to keep his sanity. It was
					better to step away and remain friends than to stay and work in that infernal
					mix. It ended up being the better choice, because otherwise I think some of them
					would have been dead by now.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">But we never canceled dates. I’d be in the dressing
					room freaking out, throwing shit around, and Kelly—designated point guy—would be
					asking, “What the hell is going on now, you fuck?” I’d be screaming at him, “I
					want to charter a helicopter <span class="italic">right now</span>! Call David.”
					David Krebs would be at home making his 15 or 20 percent asleep in his
					penthouse. He didn’t have a clue what was going on while we were banging our
					heads against the wall, losing our minds. <span class="italic">Everybody</span>
					needed time off. But it never occurred to me to cancel. I was Captain Ahab in a
					mad quest for the Great White Quark. So the gears just kept grinding on.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">It just got worse and worse. Too much money. If you
					want to control people and you know they’re weak, you give them money! Trust me
					when I tell you that. Then drugs took everybody down. It was real bad. Nick the
					roadie died of cirrhosis, another crew guy hung himself, our dealers were being
					garroted, stabbed, and given hot shots. I was the crazed lead singer
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. too high for my own good. There were car accidents every day. I
					broke a Porsche in half up in New Hampshire. Drug demons got inside everything
					and wrecked everything. Drugs even speeded up the band’s rhythm.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">And then one night .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Between Joe and me there had always been a certain
					amount of friction due to the biological fact that we’re such different
					personalities. But whatever stories you’ve read or Joe and everyone else has
					told—the eighty-thousand-dollar room service bill, the spilt milk, the solo
					album—the truth of the matter is that after nine years of playing, writing, and
					recording together I still couldn’t get through to Joe. He was in his bubble and
					I couldn’t reach him. He was insulated—by heroin, by Elyssa, by his own
					fucked-up lack of self-confidence, his inability to see that the band was bigger
					than his girlfriend, more important than his problems, his drugs. He has a great
					front, Joe .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he seems <span class="italic">so cool</span>—but then
					don’t we all. He needed his woman, Elyssa, who was cool and gorgeous and
					poisonous.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Elyssa was very caught up in that whole fashion
					thing, a model wannabe kind of girl, coming back from England with beavers and
					the black nail polish and all that kind of stuff. Joe was into role-playing as
					well, and they fed off of each other, they were always into each other’s
					games.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">She was so into herself and was easy to provoke.
					Once we were flying from New York to L.A., we’re all sitting in first class, and
					there’s a guy behind us. He leans over, taps Elyssa on the shoulder, and goes,
					“Are you what they call a ‘groupie’?” She took a glass of wine and threw it on
					this guy, and that was before the plane even took off.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">The coup de grâce came when I began to confront Joe
					about the wall he’d built around himself. I’d had enough: “Joe, do you know who
					you are?” “Yuh,” he mumbled. “There’s a hundred girls tonight that would have
					sucked your cock until a million o’clock! Are you kidding?” I said. “Well,
					Elyssa loves me,” he mumbled back. “Okay, okay, okay, and no one else does?”
					“But Elyssa I can trust.” “Wow. All right. Okay. And that’s it? That’s the end
					of the story?” Joe didn’t know his own self-worth. He didn’t get how strong a
					personality he was onstage, a character right out of rock mythology—the electric
					god who wants his guitar to sound like a dinosaur eating cars. How great is
					that? And together we were the Terrible, Toxic Twins. But he could never see
					that—so in the end he left with her.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">The straw that broke the camel’s back came on July
					28, 1979, at the World Series of Rock at the Cleveland Stadium. We were the
					headliners on a bill with Ted Nugent, Journey, Thin Lizzy, and AC/DC. Backstage
					in the trailer Elyssa and Terri Hamilton got into a flaming fight. Elyssa took a
					glass of milk and chucked it all over Terri. I wasn’t there. I heard about it
					after the show. “What’s going on?” I said. Then I got into a fight with Joe.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Joe and I weren’t there when the Big Bang occurred
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we didn’t <span class="italic">physically </span>see it. We came
					offstage into this Winnebago parked in the back of this hall. I walked in,
					panting and dripping, soaking wet, and Elyssa and Terri were screaming at each
					other. “Get the fuck out of here,” I yelled. “Can’t you see we’re working in
					here?” That’s when I found out that Elyssa had thrown milk at Terri and Terri
					just wouldn’t have it. Elyssa would take no shit from anybody and got off on
					being that way. And neither would Terri. Tom was <span class="italic"
						>spewing</span>.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Joe walked in and started stickin’ up for Elyssa,
					but when I saw Terri’s clothes all soaked, I got into it with Joe. “Man, can’t
					you come over here and control your woman?” Why does it always have to be like
					this? Worse than me, and I’m the KING of that. Always startin’ fights and
					bullshitting, but she did that and it’s what broke up the band that night. Joe
					was acting like it was Elyssa’s right to do what she did .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <span
						class="italic">and</span> he’s saying as much while <span class="italic"
						>Terri’s still in the room.</span> Didn’t care. He <span class="italic"
						>liked</span> that his wife was a troublemaker; he got off knowing that
					Elyssa could morph into a flaming bitch at the drop of a Mad Hat.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I was <span class="italic">so</span> drunk (as I
					was every night after a show), but I remember clearly being on the steps of the
					trailer, walking down and yelling at Joe, “You’re fucking fired!” I don’t even
					know where that Chairman of the Board voice came from. Never spouted off like I
					was the leader of this band! We were a gang, a unit. But I was just <span
						class="italic">so</span> angry! That was the only way I knew how to get
					Elyssa to stop it. “You’re fucking fired, Joe!” You can get into a crazy head
					space where all you want to say is “Fuck you!” I could have just said, “I’m
					outta here,” but I didn’t; instead I said, “You’re fired!” Those were the words!
					I’ve never actually punched Joe, but that night I came really close.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">It was a mess. So much of this is just so radically
					true. We <span class="italic">completely</span> fried ourselves. But again,
					unlike Sid Vicious or the Dolls and other bands that were systematically
					sabotaging their careers and lives, if one was to spell it out clinically—we
					were going down that road unconsciously, we were just getting fucked-up and,
						<span class="italic">incidentally,</span> sabotaging ourselves. Joe and I
					had that mulish Italian strain of <span class="italic"
						>stick-to-itiveness;</span> Joe’s not actually Italian, but he’s from that
					island off the coast of Italy, or is it Portugal? With the exception of his
					guitar volume, he sure the hell doesn’t know how to be loud .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and
					who the fuck knows how happy he was that night? I sure wasn’t.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">And thus ended Aerosmith Mach I. It was an insane
					thing to do after all we’d done to make it. But I had gotten so enraged I’d now
					destroyed the one thing that had made Aerosmith so powerful, that fine tension
					that created Aerosmith’s feral howl. It didn’t matter to Joe that he and I were
					a team. He didn’t care that we’d been together for almost ten years! All he
					cared about was getting high and being with <span class="italic">her</span>.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I was that angry with him, so I went, “Fuck you!
					You’re fired. I’m gonna find a new guitar player.” And I did. Jimmy Crespo. At
					least he wasn’t Joe Perry .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the cocksucker.</p>
