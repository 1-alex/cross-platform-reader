			<p class="x1chap-ttl" xml:lang='en-us'><span class="bold">Little Bo Peep, <br />the Glitter Queen, <br />and the Girl in the <br />Yellow Corvette</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm-first" xml:lang='en-us'><span class="dropcap">D</span>id women get backstage and offer themselves to us on our altar of lust? Take off their clothes, do tricks, satisfy our aching needs? Not in the beginning. Stuff like that doesn’t happen on a regular basis until you become really, really famous. But still, were there ass-shakin’ trollops in the audience who defined our existence and made our minds go into Glory Hallelujah mode? Absafuckinlootley! Hell, that’s what it’s all about!</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>Now, I’m not saying these girls didn’t come backstage after performances—of course they did. Isn’t that why they showed up to begin with? Music was one thing, but <span class="italic">my</span> thing was the other. I’d run back and get Kelly &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>“Kelly—the girl with the red dress in the front row—have her shaved and oiled and brought to my tent!” And she’d be there. As dirty as my mind is, my body’s pretty clean. Kelly always made sure the girls were in the shower when I got in the room. I liked my pulchritude pristine! I can’t kiss a girl that’s been stage diving with five hundred other guys. I’m very oral and I like clean. Back then, sure, you could’ve gotten gonorrhea, but with one shot of penicillin .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. see ya. Unlike today, STDs were a dime store a dozen in those days. How do you avoid ’em? Screw ’em through Saran Wrap? Nah, if they washed, they were clean. As someone once said, “You ain’t seen nuthin’ till you’re down on a muffin”—and I’m no different.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>After we became more famous, girls began coming backstage without having to be coaxed. Soon they started getting inventive, printing their own backstage passes for the price of a little backstage ass!</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>But early on, there were no girls doing backflips, no limos, no private jets—just the occasional girlfriend of a band member who acted like the only thing they ever blew out was their hair. Of course, there were other pleasures of the road. Like .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the girl in the yellow Corvette.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>Rewind to the summer of 1972 when we used to drive to our gigs in this truck that Mark Lehman owned, our original roadie and road manager all wrapped up in one. These days it’s probably moldering in the woods with vines growing through it. Anyway, that’s how we got to the gigs in the early days. And who wants to ride in a fucking van with the guys in the band? Sure, it’s okay to ride together when you’re on your way from Connecticut to New York to do a show. That’s a mere two hours, you’re all in the van together, and you’re psyched. You’re getting buzzed from breathing in the “eau de low tide” of the night before mixed with the sweet smell of sensimilla, stale cigarettes, and flat beer. To this day, it’s an aphrodisiac like no other to me. But the long, endless road trips in that van with guys farting, telling lame jokes, pissing in pop bottles .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that was murder.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>Somewhere in the grain belt between Indianapolis down to who knows where, I fell asleep on the top of the amps in the back of the van with my head staring out the window and my mind on Mars. I woke as the wheels rolled over half a deer that’d been sliced in two the night before by a semi. We were doing fifty-five in our International Harvester truck, christened the Good Ship Aerosmith, when I spied something yellow—it looked like a giant sour lemon drop—moving in retrograde in the next lane. My curiosity was instantly tweaked. I shouted to the driver, “Mark, slow down, and let that car we just passed catch up to us!”</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>Suddenly, I’m staring at a yellow Corvette bearing a blonde with gigantic orbs and a smile from heaven. I crawled up over the top of the amps like an infantryman on the beach at Iwo Jima and landed on Joe’s lap in the front seat. Joe goes, “What the fuck are you doing, Tyler?” “I’m just lookin’ for a kiss,” I say. “You ain’t gettin’ that from me,” said Joe. “That’s not what you said last night,” I quipped. You can’t ever really get back at a guitar player. They’ll just crank their amp up to a million and drown you out.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>She worked at the motel we’d stayed at the night before and was out on the highway doing a bit of her own randy reconnaissance. You can’t always get what you want, but she knew if she tried hard enough she could get her heart’s desire—and that was lucky me! She took me to a room and fucked my brains out. It was like three in the morning and she rolls over and caresses my back. What, <span class="italic">again</span>? Oh, baby, I thought, but what I said was “You know what? I could do this all night <span class="italic">and</span> the next day but I gotta get up really early to catch this goddamn flight.”</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>“Well we can take my Corvette,” she says. “And tell ya what .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I’ll sit on your lap and grind you till the middle of next week or you can ride my face all the way to Chicago or wherever the hell we’re going!” It didn’t matter. Time becomes meaningless in the face of creativity. Was I dreaming? Or the luckiest guy on earth? “That sounds okay to me,” I said with all the casualness I could muster.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>“But first,” she says, “I gotta go back home for a few minutes to put out some feed for the horses.” Oh yeah, I’m not in New York anymore. I end up back at her house, riding horses bareback all night, naked. Right out of a storybook. Is this really happening? Am I dreaming, or am I being dreamed? Around 5:00 <span class="sc">A.M</span>., she says, “Put your clothes on, we’re going. What the hell, I wanted to see the show anyway.” If this ain’t something I already put in a song, it sure as hell’s gonna be.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>Well, the next gig was in Davenport, Iowa, and damned if we didn’t drive that little Corvette all the way. Four beautiful hours, with mysterious fields of corn flashing by, rusty old gas stations, grain elevators, clapboard churches—and the sun’s coming up.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>Two months later, she’s still on tour with me. The guys in the band, of course, are royally pissed. Why wouldn’t they be? They’re up there reading their in-flight magazines, drooling stewardess dreams, while I’m out there getting my kicks on Route 66. I swear to god—or General Motors—I never traveled so sweetly .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to this day.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>I only wish we were on the radio right now, or on <span class="italic">Oprah</span>. I would say, “If you’re out there, please call this number. I want to know how you are, what you’re doing, and what you look like now!” Of course, sometimes you don’t wanna know. You’d rather remember them the way they were—the way we all were.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>Later on, when fame comes, things change. We’re in all the pop magazines and gossip columns, we’re fuckin celebrities, and we’ve got an impressive entourage of haute coke dealers and purveyors of other things for the discerning drug addict. Everybody wants to be my baby, everyone wants to kiss my ass.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>“But isn’t that what you always wanted, Steven?” my guardian angel in a pink bustier asks. Hell yeah, baby. Whatever you say.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>But Fame is a bitch. You’ve probably heard that somewhere, but only because it’s goddamn true. It’s a riderless horse, it’s a two-headed dog sniffing its own butt, a one-eyed cat peeking in a seafood store. And .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it’s the absolute greatest generator of creative fiction there is. You make it up, then <span class="italic">they</span> make it up. And as soon as you get well known enough for people to want to make stuff up about you, they will. It’s not up to you anymore; the demon is on the loose. Everybody you work with, buy a car from, hire as a babysitter; everyone who fixes your computer. Each becomes, overnight, a writer of short stories, a chronicler of mouth-watering scandal.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>Remember who we’re talking about! Famous people. Why, they’re capable of almost anything you can imagine. They’re degenerate, ruthless, heartless, and disgusting, so pile it on. Anyone who’s worked for Paul McCartney, believe me, has a story to tell.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>“I saw Macca massaging her stump!” “Get out!” “No, really!”</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>Of course, that’s all we ever wanted: to be famed and acclaimed, but be careful what you wish for, because fame is the bitch goddess of rumor, innuendo, slander, and gossip and the perverted purveyor of tabloid trash. She’ll say anything to anyone anywhere. “Pssst! Wanna hear some real hot stories about Steven Whatsisname? <span class="italic">How he got there</span> and what he did to whom when he got there. It’ll make your hair stand on end—and that’s not all that’ll stand on end, baby. Wanna see some Paris Hilton–type sex tapes? Wanna hear some nasty shit secretly recorded by his babysitter—I swear!” Oh, yeah .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that shit goes on. Tapes of the babysitter overhearing every private conversation you ever had with your children, band mates, accountants, ex-wives, even your fucking proctologist. In the end, even the babysitter’s story makes you look like an asshole.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>Once you become a rock star—something you’ve prayed for fervently since you were sixteen, making promises to sleazy saints and strange goddesses of the night—all bets are off.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>After you’re famous, it’s all simple and brutal: you’re either loved across the board for things you <span class="italic">did </span>do .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or sneered at for things you <span class="italic">didn’t </span>do—or vice versa. Either way, you become a dartboard for other people’s fears, doubts, and insecurities, and right there in the bull’s-eye are the two terrible tabloid twins: sex and drugs. Now, of course, the good stories—we claim proud ownership of those. As for all the rest, well, we don’t read our own press .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. wink wink. But that’s horseshit. One way or another we eventually get to hear all the news that’ll blow a fuse. If we don’t read it, we’re sure to hear it from girlfriends, mothers, fathers—or our best friends. Then there’s the occasional “Tyler’s in Room 221” written in smoky letters across the sky by a stunt pilot who found that we were staying at the Four Seasons in Maui, who got his info from the concierge who got it from the bellboy who got a phone call from the airline steward who sent the call the second he saw your ugly face getting off the plane. “LEND THE FAMILY PARROT TO THE TOWN CRIER!”</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>No matter what you do, there’s someone putting together a little bag of anecdotes in which you’re prominently featured doing nasty stuff. If I get gas down at the corner, the woman who pumps my gas is going to be telling all her friends the next day. And the story will grow: not only do I get my gas there <span class="italic">all</span> the time, but I get my car serviced there, and, as matter of fact, I had dinner over at her house the night before and watched <span class="italic">American Idol</span> with her and made popcorn. And if she happens to be good-looking and your wife finds out, then you’ve automatically had an affair with this girl. That Stevie! The kind of things he asks you to do!</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>So, go on, make it up! By now Steven Tyler is pretty much a fictional character anyway—I have absolutely no control over the little fuck. I read about him and I don’t know who it is.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>Just the other day, I open a book and what do I find? A former Aerosmith accountant, a perfectly reasonable, rational person—someone who adds up columns of figures, divides them, amortizes them, collateralizes them—has turned into a writer of bodice-ripper romances. She’s telling a lurid tale featuring little old me. The woman’s become an authority on my sex life: <span class="italic">My dear, there’s a little-known fact I’ll share with you about Steven Tyler .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Something that few people know. </span>By this point we’re all holding our breath, we’re spellbound. In a hoarse whisper, she continues: <span class="italic">He makes his groupies put on kinky costumes. Oh, yes, he designs them himself. He makes them recite nursery rhymes while he fucks them. He can’t get it up unless they’re dressed up as Little Bo Peep, Little Miss Muffet, Little Red Riding Hood</span>. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>What a perv that Steven is! And that was my <span class="italic">accountant</span>!</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>Back to our story already in progress. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The band hits warp speed in the Midwest. At the helm our driver, Mark Lehman, a one-man hump-amp, rig-lights, set-up-sound-system wizard. When I saw <span class="italic">Almost Famous </span>I said, “Holy shit, is this sideways Aerosmith or what?” We were on that bus, in that plane, diving naked off rooftops into the way-out-o-sphere along with fellow demon Ted Nugent. The hallways were crowded with bad girls, seedy characters, and a waiter named Julio delivering groupies on a room service cart.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>Now, one night after our show at the Paramount Theatre in Seattle in late November 1973, we’re all in this big room backstage, and our very considerate promoter had invited these girls there for us. “I’ve got a little surprise for you boys.” My, my, my, what do I spy with my little eye? Six nubile young chicks, one cuter than the next. They curtsy and introduce themselves to the band. One says, “Hello, boys, we’re the Little Oral Annie Club.” Well, beam me up, Scotty, says I.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>Then she says, “Well, sir, we’ve taught each other how to give great head, so when we meet rock stars .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we blow you like no man has been blown before.” To have two girls come up and say, “Hi, we’ll do each other, wanna watch?” is mind-boggling. Six hot girls and one of them whispers in your ear, “I can eat her pussy right here and now better than anyone on the planet.” I think I can safely speak for all males of the species .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. this moment would have changed your religion.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>All these girls were dressed up fantasy style in sexy costumes. Guys are very predictable creatures. We <span class="italic">all</span> like schoolgirls in plaid skirts, women in high heels and fishnet stockings. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Strawberry Fields, as she called herself, was their den mother—kind of heavyset and a little older, but she knew what rock stars—hell, what all boys—wanted. As for the <span class="italic">me </span>that I thought I knew? He’d left the building! This woman <span class="italic">knew</span>. She knew how to take care of her girls and how to please the boys.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>Speaking of which, remember a little group of nasty girls called the Plaster Casters? There were originally two Plaster Casters, but soon more were needed. If Led Zeppelin were in town, say, and the first two girls were busy .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, that night they would send another couple of girls over to do the Allman Brothers. Eventually there were more girls involved at each session: a plethora of plasterers. One cooked up the plaster, the second one did the fluffing, and the third one would cast the mold and put it in her Easy-Bake oven. I never had my plaster casted, ’cause I always believed in mystery meat. I figured if I got the cast, it would wind up on someone’s mantelpiece somewhere, and people would be going, “<span class="italic">That’s</span> Steven Tyler’s dick?” We’d lost half our audience right there.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>The girls are parading around in their outfits, and I’m talking to Strawberry Fields—she’s got my attention—and other parts of my anatomy, too, by now—and she’s telling me all the stuff they do. Groupie Geishas! I wanted to say, “As long as I’ve got a face, you’ll always have a place to sit,” but it came out, “Igloo boffrim modden ginsky” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but what I meant to say was “Blahimi auhfern koofnard gynolia?”</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>“So, uh, you girls, you dress up in different outfits?” I asked.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>“Well, of course, we have any kind of costume you want,” chimes Ms. Fields. “Just tell me. We’re here to please.” This was way before you could call a service and say, “Send over a couple of hookers dressed up like Jack Sparrow and Whoopi Goldberg.” Strawberry Fields had the costumes made to order for your particular perverted fantasy—any fucking fantasy your twisted little heart desired. Out of this entire erotic circus, there was one day where seven girls showed up dressed like Joe Perry with tits. No one got laid <span class="italic">that</span> night.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>Penny Lane, the groupie Kate Hudson played in <span class="italic">Almost Famous,</span> could easily have been based on sweet .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. hell, I’m not even going to give the girl a pseudonym, but that <span class="italic">was</span> her, my girlfriend to be, one of the six girls in the Little Oral Annie Club we met that night. She was sixteen, she knew how to nasty, and there wasn’t a hair on it. With my bad self being twenty-six and she barely old enough to drive and sexy as hell, I just fell madly in love with her. She was a cute skinny little tomboy dressed up as Little Bo Peep. She was my heart’s desire, my partner in crimes of passion.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>Early on in the band when I was still Jung and easily Freudened, I’d blurt out my sexual fantasies. I thought I was just being honest and saying what was on everybody’s mind, but I made the mistake of talking this stuff in front of the band’s wives. You know, stuff like how I liked doing it with two girls—twins, preferably. “You’re disgusting, Steve!” one of the band wives blurted out (I hate it when people call me “Steve”; always a tinge of squinge attached to Steve). I’d say, “What? Boys don’t like threesomes? Don’t <span class="italic">all</span> boys dream about that?”</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>And did I expect my band mate to say, “Oh, yeah, I’m sorry, baby, that <span class="italic">is</span> my secret fantasy. And, honey, while Steven’s brought up the subject of sexual fantasies, did I ever tell you I’ve always wanted you to dress up in a Nazi uniform and order me to goose-step on your great white plain?” What was I thinking? No man is going to tell his wife what he really likes. Because when he gets home, she’ll Lorena Bobbitt his ass and he’ll never find his licorice nib again.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>Any cop will tell you that the things people lie about most are sex and drugs—and in that order—so hypocrisy is the order of the day. I would just sit there, flabbergasted, going, “Oh, really? You mean boys <span class="italic">don’t</span> like girls going down on each other?” I think I’m on firm theoretical grounds in saying this, but I always welcome other points of view.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>Of course, nowadays, in every fuck club or strip joint, it’s fashionable—hell, it’s mandatory—for two girls to kiss and jam out with their clam out. Why did it take so long? That’s how they get your attention; now they <span class="italic">know</span>.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>Can I help it if I was ahead of my time? Back then, I used to say, “Aw, c’mon, all guys like a close shave.” In the year 2011 it’s become fashionable for girls from sixteen to sixty to be cut to the quick. It’s waxed, smacked, and shellacked. Do we need to do a survey? They may have a landing strip, so flight attendants, please remain seated until my face comes to a complete and full stop. I remember one night on the road when Joe and I were sharing a bed with two girls and woke up in the morning with a seafood blue plate special. Crabs for .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. everybody! And I’m the last guy on the planet to use that little Barbie Doll comb that used to come with a bottle of A-200 that would burn the critters out. At one point, I had so many crabs, I used to say good night to them.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>My little oral Annie came back with me to the hotel, the Edgewater Inn in Seattle, where we sat in the tub for two hours, naked with no water, when it dawned on me there was an emergency cord in the bus we’d taken to the hotel. So I went down (on my way knocking on Ted Nugent’s door), cut the cord with a pair of pliers I had in my bag, brought it up to my room, attached a fish hook from hell to it, ordered ham sandwiches—which is all you could get after midnight—put the ham on the hook, and dropped it out the window. We pulled up mud sharks and codfish for the next four hours and proceeded to clean the fish and gut the two sharks. Then Ted says, “Check this out.” And lays the two hearts on the sink. “Okay, now go to bed,” orders the madman. Next morning, my phone rings and it’s Ted. “Steven, go into the bathroom and check out the heart.” I touch the sea critter with my finger and I’ll be damned if the heart didn’t start beating .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. nine hours later! Which only proves one thing .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. which I can’t remember just now. “You can’t kill a lawyer,” could that be it?</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>Nugent suggested we have a fish fry at the gig. So we filleted the cod we caught, put ’em in a cooler, and took ’em to the gig that night with us. I offered him my crabs, but he politely declined.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>I was so in love I almost took a teen bride. I went and slept at her parents’ house for a couple of nights and her parents fell in love with me, signed papers over for me to have custody, so I wouldn’t get arrested if I took her out of state. I took her on tour with me. My Sweet Eeee.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
			<p class="x1song-first" xml:lang='en-us'><span class="italic">Standin’ in front just shakin’ your ass,</span></p>
			<p class="x1song-mid" xml:lang='en-us'><span class="italic">Take you backstage you can drink from my glass.</span></p>
			<p class="x1song-mid" xml:lang='en-us'><span class="italic">Talk about something you can sure understand</span></p>
			<p class="x1song-last" xml:lang='en-us'><span class="italic">’Cause a month on the road and I’ll be eatin’ from your hand.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>That was her. I lived with her for three years. She was a sweet, mysterious creature .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. very smart, and she knew what she liked and what I liked. We took baths together. She wore skirts with no panties. We did it on the red-eye from L.A. to Boston .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that kind of stuff. All the things that guys dream about.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>We made love in public, in private, and tried positions the <span class="italic">Kama Sutra </span>has yet to come up with. One time we started out in a hot tub on the roof and wound up in the lobby. We got out of the hot tub naked and into the elevator and dared each other we couldn’t make it all the way down to our room without being seen. We hit every floor starting with the lobby .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. unfortunately, it went there first. It was so erotic and romantic that by the time we got to the lobby, we were coming and going all at the same time. When the doors opened, there was an Amish family staring at us like figures in an oil painting. The door closes, then it opens again, and someone says, “Can I have your autograph?”</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>That sweet girl used to recite poetry and constantly sing songs to me like my mother did when she put me to sleep. It was an inspiration to my heart. One of the songs she taught me was “We Are Siamese,” which I’m sure you’ll all remember from the movie <span class="italic">Lady and the Tramp.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>Like I said, so sweet. Not like me.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>At the end of the tour I brought her home to Boston. We got on well for a while .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we were best friends and did everything together. She even knew how to mow a lawn. That impressed me. There’s a picture of us in <span class="italic">People</span> magazine sitting on my tractor. But toward the end things started to derail. We got so messed up on drugs and were so out of control that the dark side started taking over. And while I was on the road, our apartment almost burned down and she wound up in the hospital with smoke inhalation. I went to see her in the hospital and that’s when reality slapped me in the face. When you love somebody, set them free. And I just had to let her go. She went back to her parents, but I can still see her in the songs we sang together. And the greatest thing she taught me .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that <span class="italic">love is love reflected</span>.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>So much to be dealt with when you fall. And I fell hard. And I fell heavy. And I fell so in love. Was it from songs? From my Italian family? From heaven or hell? I’m a breeder. Been married twice. They say never trust a rock musician? We can write songs about love but we’re not allowed to <span class="italic">be</span> in love. “Oh, yeah, that’s right. I fell in love with you from the side of the stage, surrounded <span class="italic">by other women,</span>” your significant other would say if she were honest. But they don’t think that. You get <span class="italic">married,</span> and sometimes you fall from God’s grace. You’re sitting there saying to them, “Yeah, but sweetheart .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you see the girls screaming at me every night. I don’t sleep with them, I just make love to them through my music. And that stage is my mistress. Why are you angry at <span class="italic">me</span>?” And, actually, I <span class="italic">liked</span> it. When I was younger and easily impressed I watched my heroes and I was enticed by that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the crowds, the adulation, the sexuality, and the girls that loved rock guys. It certainly wasn’t the money.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>You know, guys in rock bands aren’t the only devils. Wives can be just as bad. I’ve known some wives that cheated on the guys while they were on tour and the husbands never knew it! And they said I should be wearing the genital cuff?</p>
			<p class="x1bm-after-txb1-art-below" xml:lang='en-us'><span class="sbdropcap">I</span> came up with the second album title, <span class="italic">Get Your Wings,</span> after reading a book on the Hells Angels. Getting your wings is a Hells Angels thing. If you give a girl head when she has her period, you are definitely one of the guys and, my friend, you’ve got your wings. The album came out in March 1974—and we were on the road again. We toured like gypsy possessed. We opened for Mott the Hoople, Black Sabbath, Blue Öyster Cult, the Guess Who, and Kiss. We were on tour continually and endlessly. We made as little as five hundred dollars a night in places where they didn’t know us and almost four grand where they did. <span class="italic">Get Your Wings </span>was bubbling in the Hot 100. And as a result of our never-ending road juggernaut, it got us our first gold record the following year.</p>

			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>That spring we opened for Hawkwind (the Brit sci fi rockers) at Alex Cooley’s Electric Ballroom in Atlanta. Every night there’d be a girl in the front row, very scantily clad, silver glitter spray all over her body, and little nipple cups. And really <span class="italic">hot</span>. Stone gorgeous. She was the Glitter Queen and she came to every show we ever played in Atlanta.</p>
				
			
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>We did a great show at Cooley’s one night. I was up in the dressing room afterward .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the backstage was full of people, along with a couple of girls in the dressing room, naked. My old childhood friend Ray was there. He was working his ass off with the band and had a bag of blow. Ray had the greatest connections—the red Lebanese hash with a camel embossed on the bag, same as the stuff he’d scored for Led Zeppelin—oh how they loved that shit!</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>One of my band mates took a look at the Glitter Queen and he was <span class="italic">gone</span>! She disappeared and so did he. I think she swallowed him up a couple of times.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>The girl standing there in front of me was <span class="italic">hot,</span> not to mention very ambidextrous. She could bend over backward—my kinda girl—and she had a flat head where I could rest my beer. A little-known quality in those who bend. Later, Ray had this same girl in the toilet stall, she’s standing on her head with her feet up against the wall, and he’s pretending to pour Jack Daniel’s into her ’gynie .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but actually pouring it into a shot glass and sticking the shot glass into her coo-ha and drinking out of it with a straw. When Ray was done, he poured Jack on his schvantz ’cause he thought it would kill the herpes he was about to get. One snort leads to another, and pretty soon it’s two hours later.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>My band mate—who will remain nameless—is hiding backstage, ramming the Glitter Queen with the silver paint all over her body, while we’re getting gacked to the nines on blow (which we called “krell”) in the dressing room. Mötley Crüe says they coined that term for coke in the eighties after the Krell, the people who lived on the <span class="italic">Forbidden Planet.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>“Hey, where were you?” I inquire, when said band mate returns. But when he gets close enough, we know. We all fall down laughing because his face and shirt are covered with silver glitter paint. There’s silver paint in his hair, glitter all over his mouth—his penis looks like the Tin Man. And up behind him comes the Glitter Queen herself with all the silver paint rubbed off her breasts and her pussy. Oh, man!</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>We’d come offstage just shy of midnight. They’d shooed everybody out of the club and closed up. By now it’s 3:00 <span class="sc">A.M</span>. I go downstairs and I can’t get out so I run back up. “Omigod, you guys, we’re chained in! There are chains across every door.” What <span class="italic">were</span> we going to do! Locked in with a pile of blow, Jack Daniel’s, and a bunch of hot naked chicks? The only way to get out was to force open the door a crack and then you could climb up and over—which I did. I got out, made a phone call to Alex Cooley, and it took an hour before anybody came .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for the fifth time. I know, I know. We were younger then.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>Upon returning to the hotel I recited my nightly prayer&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
			<p class="x1song-first" xml:lang='en-us'><span class="italic">Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep</span></p>
			<p class="x1song-mid" xml:lang='en-us'><span class="italic">You keep my soul, I know it’s taken</span></p>
			<p class="x1song-last" xml:lang='en-us'><span class="italic">Hope you don’t mind if I stab my bacon.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>All these girls had to do was look on the back of the album and see what the tour manager’s name was—and if you’re in Chicago, call up every hotel that Aerosmith might be staying at, which would whittle it down to maybe four, call the front desk and say, “I’m looking for Kelly, he’s my cousin, he’ll be coming with Aerosmith.” It took the fans twenty years to get hip to this and me twenty-five years to figure it out.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>That is assuming, and it’s quite a lot to assume, that the tour manager would have even been available or would have given a fuck about my aching needs. Tour managers, I found out later, had other things on their mind, such as hobnobbing all night long with people they knew from the last time we’d played there, people with primo blow.</p>
			<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang='en-us'><span class="sbdropcap">S</span>o many nights I went to sleep dreaming that two gorgeous, nasty twins were going to knock on my door, cover me in rose petals, and perform an after-midnight rectal examination. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But no way, they never arrived. Perhaps they didn’t know I sometimes used the name I. K. Malone when I checked in. The chick at the front desk had a field day with that. “I’ll be right up,” she would say<span class="italic">.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>You get into a hotel elevator in a place you played the night before, and you know the last fucking person you want to meet is someone going, “Oh! My god! It’s <span class="italic">you</span>!” in that Valley Girl accent. This person in the Hyatt House elevator is having a God experience and you haven’t had coffee yet. By the time you’re through your fifteenth or twentieth person having a religious experience, you wish you were a gasket salesman from Omaha.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>You get home that night, the next day you wake up—it’s your day off!—and step outside and what do you see but the three-hundred-pound guy in sweatpants you’d run into in the elevator the day before. He’s camped outside your door and he’s drying his clothes on your lawn. Perfect!</p>
