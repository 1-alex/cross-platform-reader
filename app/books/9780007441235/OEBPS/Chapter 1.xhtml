				<p class="x1bm-first-art-below" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="dropcap">I</span> was
					born at the Polyclinic Hospital in the Bronx, March 26, 1948. As soon as I could
					travel my parents headed straight out of town to Sunapee, New Hampshire, to the
					little housekeeping cottages they rented out every summer, kind of an
					old-fashioned bed-and-breakfast deal only it was 1950. I was put in a crib at
					the side of the house. A fox came by and thought I was a cub, grabbed me by the
					scruff of my diaper, and dragged me into the woods. I grew up with the animals
					and the children of the woods. I heard so much in the silence of the pine tree
					forests that I knew later in life I would have to fill that void. The only thing
					my parents knew was that I was out there somewhere. They heard me cry in the
					forest one night, but when they came up to where I was, all they saw was a big
					hole in the ground, which they thought was the fox’s den. They dug and dug and
					dug, but all they found was the rabbit hole I’d fallen into—like Alice.</p>

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">And like Alice I entered another dimension: the
					sixth dimension (the fifth dimension was already taken). Since then, I can go to
					that place anytime I want, because I know the secret of the children of the
					woods; there’s so much in silence when you know what you’re hearing—what dances
					between the psychoacoustics of any two notes and what reads between the lines is
					akin to the juxtaposition of what you see when you look in the mirror. My whole
					life has been dancing between these worlds: the <span class="sc">GOAN
						ZONE</span>, the Way-Out-o-Sphere and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the <span class="sc"
						>UNFORTUNATE STATE OF REALITY</span>. In essence, I call myself a peripheral
					visionary. I hear what people don’t say and I see what’s invisible. At night,
					because our visual perception is made up of rods and cones, if you’re going down
					a dark path, the only way to really see the path is to look off and see it in
					your peripheral vision. But more on this as we progress, regress, and
					digress.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">When I finally got pulled out of the rabbit hole,
					my parents brought me back to the third dimension. Like all parents they were
					concerned, but I was afraid to tell them that I have never felt more comfortable
					than being lost in that forest.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="sbdropcap">I</span>n
					Manhattan we lived at 124th Street and Broadway, not far from the Apollo
					Theater. Harlem, man. If the first three years of your life are the most
					informative, then surely I needed to hear that music, and I was inspired by the
					noise coming out of that theater. It had more soul than Saint Peter.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">A few years ago I was back at the Apollo, and saw
					the park where my mom had pushed me in my carriage. My first visual memory is
					from <span class="sc">THAT PARK</span>: trees and clouds moving above my head as
					if I were floating above the earth. There I am, a two-year-old astral-projecting
					infant. At age four, I remember going to get a gallon of milk with two quarters,
					walking with my mom hand in hand through passages and corridors of the basement
					of our building and through tunnels into the adjoining building where the milk
					machine was. I thought I was .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. God knows where. I might as well
					have been on Mars. Ah, it was the mysterious world of childhood, where someone
					is always leading you by the hand through a dark passageway and into a brand-new
					world just waiting for the child’s overactive imagination to kick in.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-space-below" xml:lang="en-us">My mother lit the fire that would keep
					me warm for the rest of my life. She read me parables, <span class="italic"
						>Aesop’s Fables,</span> and Rudyard Kipling’s <span class="italic">Just So
						Stories. </span>Children’s tales and nursery rhymes from the eighteen
					hundreds, nineteen hundreds: “Hickory Dickory Dock,” Andrew Lang’s <span
						class="italic">The Nursery Rhyme Book,</span> Hans Christian Andersen, Helen
					Bannerman’s <span class="italic">Little Black Sambo</span>. So great! Never mind
					the “Goose That Laid the Golden Egg!” My mom would read me all these stories
					every night at bedtime. But one night when I was around six, she stopped.</p>

					</div>
				</div>
				
					
					
					
					
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“You gotta learn how to read ’em yourself,” she
					said. Up until then I’d been reading along with her as she pointed to the words.
					We did this for months until she knew I kinda had the idea, then suddenly
					there’s no Mom looking over my shoulder. She just left the book by my bed and I
					became distraught. “Mom, I wanna <span class="italic">hear</span> the stories.
					Why won’t you read to me anymore?!” I said. And then one night I thought to
					myself, “Uh-oh, now I gotta get smart.” Naah. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I’ll just become a
					musician and write my own stories and myths .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Aeromyths.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Mom used to tell me of a man she’d seen on the
						<span class="italic">Steve Allen Show,</span> in 1956 when I was eight. His
					name was Gypsy Boots. He was the original hippie, a guy who lived in a tree with
					hair down to his waist and who promoted health food and yoga. Gypsy was <span
						class="italic">the</span> protohippie. In the early thirties he had dropped
					out of high school, wandered to California with a bunch of other so-called
					vagabonds, lived off the land, slept in caves and trees, and bathed in
					waterfalls. I was totally seduced by that lifestyle. Boots’s message was this:
					As primitive as his world seemed, he wanted people to think that he would live
					forever. Hey, he almost did, dying just eleven days before his ninetieth
					birthday in 1994.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Next in my life came a bohemian composer named Eden
					Ahbez, who wrote a song called “Nature Boy” (which my mom heard on a Nat King
					Cole record). He camped out below the first L in the Hollywood sign, studied
					Oriental mysticism, and, like Gypsy Boots, he lived on vegetables, fruits, and
					nuts. My mom sang that song to me before I went to sleep. I’ll never forget how
					it made me think that I was her nature boy.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">The song tells the story of how one day an
					enchanted wandering Nature Boy—wise and shy, with a sad, glittering eye—crosses
					the path of the singer. They sit by the fire and talk of philosophers and knaves
					and cabbages and kings. As the boy gets up to leave he imparts the secret of
					life: To love and be loved is all we know and all we need to know. With that
					Nature Boy vanishes into the night as mysteriously as he had come.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Unfortunately the people who own the rights to
					“Nature Boy” won’t let me publish the actual words&nbsp;to the song in this book
					(still, you can just&nbsp;Google them), but I promise it will be on my solo
					album come hell or high water.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Then there was Moondog. What a fantastic character,
					a blind musician who dressed up like a Viking with a helmet and horns and a
					spear to match. He hung out on the corner of Fifty-sixth Street and Sixth
					Avenue. I saw and smelled him every morning on my way to school. Oddly enough,
					he lived up in the Bronx, apparently in the woods, back behind the apartment
					buildings I grew up in. Was that a coincidence or was that God secretly telling
					me, “Steven, thou shalt become the Moondog of your generation”? Or at least the
					leader of a rock ’n’ roll band.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">What I heard about Moondog was that <span
						class="italic">he</span> wrote “Nature Boy,” but what do I know? Maybe Eden
					Ahbez is Moondog spelled backward. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-art-below" xml:lang="en-us">My mother’s birth name was Susan Rey
					Blancha. At sixteen she joined the WACs (Women’s Army Corps). She met my dad
					while they were both at Fort Dix in New Jersey during World War II. One night he
					had a date with a woman who was rooming with my mom. The roommate stood him up,
					and instead he was greeted by my mother, who happened to be playing the piano at
					the time. My dad walked over to her and said, “You’re playin’ it wrong.” It was
					love at first fight! They got married and had lil ol’ Lynda, my sister, and lil
					ol’ me came two years later. Ha-ha! That’s my mom, that’s my dad, and that’s why
					I’m so fuckin’ detail-oriented—and such a maniac. I got the traits that I don’t
					want and the ones I do. Because you’re an offspring, you pick up those traits
					unconsciously, in case you haven’t noticed. You become your mom!</p>

					mixture of classical Juilliard boy meets country pinup girl, who, by the way,
					looked like a cross between Jean Harlow and Marlene Dietrich with a tinge of
					Elly May Clampett. And if God’s in the details—and we know She is—then I’m the
					perfect combination. I’m the N in my parents’ DNA. So now, if anyone’s mad at me
					and calls me a dick, I know they really mean Fort Dix. My daughter Chelsea
					always thought God was a woman from the day she was born. It was so nurturing
					hearing that from a child, that God would have to be a woman, that I just never
					questioned it. (No wonder I keep watching <span class="italic"

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Mom was a free spirit, a hippie before her time.
					She loved folktales and fairy tales but hated <span class="italic">Star
						Trek</span>. She used to say, “Why are you watching that? All the stories
					are from the Bible&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. just six ways from Sunday. Get the
					Bible!” And I thought, “Oh, boy, that’s just what I wanna do after I’ve rolled a
					doobie and I’m smokin’ it with Spock.” And by the way, that’s why teenagers
					today go, “Whatever!” But you know—and I can only admit this in the cocktail
					hours of my life—<span class="sc">SHE WAS RIGHT</span>!!!!! Isaac Asimov’s <span
						class="italic">I Robot,</span> Aldous Huxley’s <span class="italic">Brave
						New World, </span>that’s where they got their inspiration. In the same way
					that Elvis got his sound from Sister Rosetta Tharpe (I dare you to YouTube her
						<span class="italic">right now</span>), Ernest Tubb, Bob Wills, and Roy
					Orbison. And they, in turn, begat the Beatles and they begat the Stones and they
					begat Elton John, Marvin Gaye, Carole King, and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Aerosmith. So
					study your rock history, son. That be the Bible of the Blues.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1-art-below" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="sbdropcap"
						>I</span> was three when we moved to the Bronx, to an apartment building at
					5610 Netherland Avenue, around the corner from where the comic book characters
					Archie and Veronica supposedly lived (I guess that makes me Jughead). We lived
					there till I was nine—on the top floor, and the view was spectacular. I would
					sneak out the window onto the fire escape on hot summer nights and pretend I was
					Spider-Man. The living room was a magical space. It was literally eight feet by
					twelve! There was a TV in the corner that was dwarfed by Dad’s Steinway grand
					piano. There’s my dad sitting at the piano, practicing three hours every day,
					and me building my imaginary world under his piano.</p>

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">It was a musical labyrinth where even a
					three-year-old child could be whisked away into the land of psychoacoustics,
					where beings such as myself could get lost dancing between the notes. I <span
						class="italic">lived</span> under that piano, and to this day I still love
					getting lost under the cosmic hood of all things. Getting <span class="italic"
						>into </span>it. Beyond examining the nanos, I want to know about what lives
					in the fifth within a triad .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as opposed to <span class="sc"
						>DRINKING</span> a fifth! I’ve certainly got the psycho part .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
					now if I could only get the acoustic part down (although I did write a little
					ditty called “Season of Wither”).</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">And that’s where I grew up, under the piano,
					listening and living in between the notes of Chopin, Bach, Beethoven, Debussy.
					That’s where I got that “Dream On” chordage. Dad went to Juilliard and ended up
					playing at Carnegie Hall; when I asked him, “How do you get to Carnegie Hall?”
					he said, like an Italian Groucho, “Practice, my son, practice.” The piano was
					his mistress. Every <span class="italic">key</span> on that piano had its own
					personal and emotional resonance for him. He didn’t play by rote. God, every
					note was like a first kiss, and he read music like it was written for him.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I remember crawling up underneath the piano and
					running my fingers on top of the soundboards and feeling around. It was a little
					dusty, and as I was looking up, dust spilled down and hit me in the eyes—dust
					from a hundred years ago .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ancient piano dust. It fell in my eyes
					and I thought, “Wow! Beethoven dust—the very stuff he breathed.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">It was a full-blown Steinway grand piano, not a
					little upright in the corner—a big shiny black whale with black and white teeth
					that swims at the bottom of my mind and from a great depth hums strange tunes
					that come from I know not where. <span class="italic">20,000 Leagues Under the
						Sea</span> had nothing on me.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Later on, I went back to visit 5610 Netherland
					Avenue. I knocked on the door of apartment 6G, my old apartment. It had been
					years, and the man who answered was drunk and in his underwear and
					undershirt.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“Dad?” I asked. He cocked his head like Nipper, the
						RCA dog.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“Hi, I’m—” I started to say.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“Oh, I know who <span class="italic">you</span>
					are,” said he. “From the TV. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What are you doin’ here?”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“I used to live here,” I said.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“Well raise my rent!” said he.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-space-below" xml:lang="en-us">So I went in and looked around, and
					doesn’t it always seem that the apartments we all grew up in are so much smaller
					compared to how they felt thirty years ago? My god, the kitchen was tiny, four
					by six! The bedroom I grew up in with my sister, Lynda, and my parents’ master
					bedroom facing the courtyard—you couldn’t have changed your <span class="italic"
						>mind</span> in there, never mind your clothes. How the hell did my father
						<span class="italic">get </span>a Steinway grand into that living room? So
					weird seeing this very tiny apartment with an even smaller
					black-and-white-screen TV on which I’d watched in wide-eyed abandon shows like
						<span class="italic">The Mickey Mouse Club</span> and <span class="italic"
						>The Wonderful World of Disney,</span> which premiered on October 27, 1954.
					So between growing up at three underneath a piano and seeing my black-and-white
					television world turn into color by the age of six, that was enough right there
					to prepare me for life. I couldn’t wait to jump into the middle of it.</p>

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">My dad played those sonatas with so much emotion it
					vibrated into my very bones. When you hear that music from beginning to end day
					after day, it becomes embedded in your psyche. Those notes vibrate in your ears
					and brain. So for the rest of your life your emotions can be easily subliminally
					tapped into by music.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Most humans who are panning for gold—looking for
					that ecstatic moment—first find it in their own sexuality; then they have an
					orgasm and <span class="italic">whoops,</span> it’s over. Now, imagine someone
					exploring, perhaps in search of their destiny. He stumbles upon a cave and out
					of sheer curiosity crawls inside and then looks up—it’s all glittering and
					sparkling, and for that first moment I was in Superman’s North Pole crystal
					palace cave and the crystals resonated with Mother Earth’s birthing cries.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-space-below" xml:lang="en-us">I didn’t know what I was hearing, and
					didn’t understand then where it all came from. It didn’t matter. I wanted to be
					a part of that. Little did I know, I was. It was pure magic. My dad manifested
					those crystal moments playing the notes of those sacred sonatas. It was like a
					mixture of Yma Sumac and the songs of humpback whales—these godlike sounds came
					showering down on me.</p>

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Just recently my dad came over to the house—he’s
					ninety-three now! And I sat down next to him at the piano and he played
					Debussy’s <span class="italic">Clair de Lune.</span> It was so much deeper than
					anything I have ever done or ever will do. It was so deep and invoked so much of
					that early emotion laid on top of my adult emotions that I wept like a baby. I
					remember that when I first heard it as a child I almost stopped breathing.
					Sometimes you can’t appreciate how fortunate you are until you look back and get

				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="sbdropcap">S</span>unapee,
					New Hampshire, was where I spent my summers as a kid. Driving up to Sunapee we’d
					go past Bellows Falls and Mom would say, “Bellows Falls? Fellow’s Balls!” There
					was so much to my mother. Like the way she’d get me to eat my peas. “Whatever
					you do, <span class="italic">do not eat those</span>!” And I gave her a frog
					smile.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">A few years later, say around 1961, when I’d call
					for my mother from the other side of the house, my mom would go, “Yo! Where
						<span class="italic">are</span> you? Where’d you go?” Now I wonder where
						<span class="italic">she’s</span> gone. She was a beautiful Philadelphia
					Darby Creek country girl who came to the city to bring us up, let me have long
					hair in school, argued with the principals, drove us to our first club dates,
					and loved and nurtured me—the whoever I was and/or wanted to be.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">In the fifties, it would take us seven hours to go
					from New York up to New Hampshire because in those days it was all on back roads
					(there were no highways). But the ride up to Sunapee was filled with fantastic
					roadside attractions. A giant stone <span class="italic">Tyrannosaurus

				<p class="x1bm-art-below" xml:lang="en-us">Trow-Rico, our summer resort in New Hampshire, was
					named after Trow Hill, a local landmark, and Tallarico, my father’s name, just
					smushed together. The cottages were on 360 acres of nothing but woods and
					fields. It was my grandfather Giovanni Tallarico’s dream when he came over from
					Italy in 1921 with four other brothers. Pasquale was the youngest, a child
					prodigy on the piano. Giovanni and Francesco played mandolins. Michael played
					guitar. They were a touring band in the 1920s—it’s where I get my on-the-road
					DNA. I’ve seen brochures for the Tallarico Brothers—they performed in giant
					hotels with huge ballrooms in places like Connecticut and Detroit. They went
					from New York by train to these hotels all over the country and played their
					type of music, to their type of people. Sound familiar?</p>

					salad from scratch. We served all the guests—which came to what? eight families,
					some twenty-odd people—in our heyday. After dinner, while the sun was going
					down, we’d fill in the trailer with hay, attach it to the back of a ’49 Willys
					Jeep, and take everybody on a ride all over the property. We also had a common
					dining room where we served them breakfast and dinner, and guests would do lunch
					on their own, all for, like, thirty dollars a week. Sometimes six dollars a
					night. And when the people left, my whole family got pots and pans out of the

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">As soon as I was old enough, they put me to work.
					First it was clipping hedges. When I snapped back, “What do I have to do that
					for?” my uncle said, “Just make it nice and shut up.” He used to call me
					Skeezix. He’d spent most of World War II in the Fiji Islands, so he knew how to
					take care of business and anything else that gave us any trouble. I helped him
					dig ditches and put in a water pipeline over a mile of mountain and dug a pond
					with my bare hands. I washed pots and dishes at night and mowed the lawns with
					my father when I was old enough to push a mower. I cleaned toilets, made the
					beds, and picked up all the cigarette butts that the guests left behind.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">We would rake up the hay with pitchforks and put it
					in the barn below the lower forty. The downstairs of the barn was empty except
					for maple syrup buckets and wooden and metal taps for the trees that some family
					had left before we lived there. It was quite an adventure going down there—full
					of spiderwebs, stacks of buckets, glass jars, and artifacts from the twenties
					and thirties—all those dusty, rusty things kids love to get into—me in
					particular.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Upstairs in the barn, there was a hayloft door with
					an opening where you’d load the hay in and out. I could climb up there and jump
					down from the rafters of the ceiling. I did my first backflip in that barn,
					because the hay was so soft, it was like landing on, well, hay. I always kept an
					eye out for pitchforks left behind. Land on one of those suckers and I would
					have learned how to scream the way I do now .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. twenty years
					earlier.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Before I could go to the beach with the rest of the
					guests I had to finish doing my chores. After a while I came up with a plan. It
					was called: get up earlier.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday during the
					summer my father played the piano at Soo Nipi Lodge along with my uncle Ernie on
					sax. They had a trumpet player named Charlie Gauss, a stand-up bass player named
					Stuffy Gregory, and a drummer who will go unnamed. Soo Nipi Lodge—which today
					would probably be called Snoop Dog Lodge—was one of the classic old hotels, like
					the one in <span class="italic">The Shining:</span> all wooden and splendiferous
					and huge, with dining rooms and decks outside with rocking chairs and
					screened-in porches. Chill central by today’s standards. They began building
					these resorts in the 1870s, when horses and buggies brought the guests from the
					train station to the hotels. The only thing missing was the musicians to play
					music and entertain the guests—and this is probably how the Tallarico brothers
					came to buy the land there.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">During Prohibition, people would take the train up
					from New York to Sunapee, and the booze would come down from Canada. Some folks
					drank, some didn’t. Maybe they came up for the weekend to see the leaves turn,
					but I have a funny feeling they got on the train for a quick weekend away—take
					horse-and-buggy rides, stay at the big hotels, and cruise in the old steamboats.
					The ones in Sunapee Harbor today are replicas of the original ones from a
					hundred years ago. Very quaint. Ten miles up the road was New London, the
					original Peyton Place, where, oddly enough, Tom Hamilton was born. But then
					again, it all makes perfect sense to me now.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">On Sunday nights, Dad would give recitals at
					Trow-Rico. People from miles around would come over to hear him, and my grandma,
					my mother, and my sister would play duets. All the families that came up had
					kids, and Aunt Phyllis would holler, “C’mon, Steven, let’s put on a show for
					them!” Downstairs from the piano room was the barn’s playroom: Ping-Pong, a
					jukebox, a bar, and, of course, a dartboard. There was also a big curtain across
					one corner of the room that made a stage where my aunt Phyllis taught all the
					kids camp songs like “John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt” and the “Hole in the
					Bucket” song. I would pantomime to an old 78 recording of “Animal Crackers.” It
					was an evening of camp-style vaudeville. For the finale, we hung a white sheet
					in front of a table made from two sawhorses and a board. Someone from the
					audience would be brought back to lie on the board, and behind them a giant lamp
					cast shadows on the sheet. My uncle Ernie would perform an operation on the
					person lying down, pretending to saw him in half and eventually pull out a
					baby—quite horrifying and hilarious to the audience. It was all very
					tongue-in-cheek but certainly the beginning of my career.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">We must have done a hundred and fifty or more of
					those shows over the years. I was a serious ham. I’d do cute things kids can get
					away with—especially to adoring relatives. It was like something from a Mickey
					Rooney movie. I’d learned all the lyrics to that song “Kemo-Kimo.”</p>
				<p class="x1song-first" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">Keemo kyemo stare o
						stare</span></p>
				<p class="x1song-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">Ma hye, ma ho, ma rumo
						sticka pumpanickle</span></p>
				<p class="x1song-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">Soup bang, nip cat,
						polly mitcha cameo</span></p>
				<p class="x1song-last" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">I love you</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">And then I’d add something like “Sticky sticky
					Stambo no so Rambo, had a bit a basket, tama ranna nu-no.” What the hell was
					that? The beginning of my love for real out-there music and crazy lyrics.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-space-below" xml:lang="en-us">Before I got involved in doing chores
					at Trow-Rico, before I discovered girls and pot and playing in bands, I had a
					great life in the woods with my slingshot and BB gun. As soon as we got up
					there, I’d be gone in the woods and fields. And I never came back till
					dinnertime. I was a mountain boy, barefoot and wild. I walked through the woods,
					looked up at the trees, the birds, the squirrels—it was my own private paradise.
					I’d tie a stick to a rope and make a swing from any tree branch. I was brought
					up that way, a wild child of the woods and ponds. But of course, nobody believes
					that about me. They don’t know what to think when I say, “You know, I’m just a
					country boy.”</p>

				<p class="captions" xml:lang="en-us">1961—we all gotta start
					somewhere.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. (Ernie Tallarico)</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">No waves, no wind. If you go into a recording
					studio that’s soundproofed, something just feels wrong to your ears. Especially
					when they close the door—that’s sound deprivation, it’s anechoic, without echo,
					without sound. Not so in the woods. In that silence I heard something else
					there, too.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I lost all that mystery when I was on drugs. Coming
					out of that din I was able to feel my spiritual connection to the woods again.
					Drugs will steal you like a crook. Spirituality, over. I could no longer see the
					things I used to see in my peripheral vision. No periphery, no visions.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I used to go up in the woods and sit by myself and
					hear the wind blow. As a kid, I’d come across places where the woodland
					creatures lived. Tiny human creatures. I’d see mossy beds, cushions of pine
					needle, nooks and crannies under the roots of upturned trees, hollow logs. I’d
					look around for elves, because how could it be <span class="italic">that
					</span>beautiful and strange and nobody live there! All of this tweaked my
					imagination into such a state that I knew there was something there besides me.
					If you could sleep on moss that thick it would be bliss. I’d smell that green
					grass. I would see a natural little grotto in the woods and say to myself,
					“That’s where their house must be.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">A few years ago I found a moss bed for sale at this
					lady’s little store in New London. The place was full of nature stuff—and had a
					big wooden arch in front and giant bird wings. The bed is made of twigs, with a
					moss mattress, grouse feathers for pillows, a wooden nest, an ostrich egg
					cracked in half with a little message on it, and the prints of the fairies that
					were born on the bed. We kept it in the house so my two children, Chelsea and
					Taj, would see it and just know that fairies were born on that bed. They’d say,
					“For real?” and I’d say, “For real.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I bought the two fields I used to go walking in. I
					haven’t gone out into the woods lately to see if they’ve been touched; I’m
					afraid to find out if it’s all still there as I remember it. But I grew up with
					these creatures. I was alone in the forest but I was never lonely. That’s where
					my first experiences of otherness came from, of the other world. My spiritual
					ideas didn’t come from the Lord’s Prayer or church or pictures in the Bible,
					they came from the stillness<span class="italic">.</span> The silence was so
					different from anything I would ever experience. The only noise that you heard
					in a pine tree forest was the gentle whistling sound of the wind blowing through
					the needles. Other than that, it’s just quiet .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. like after a fresh
					snow. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It really quiets down in the woods .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
					cracking branches .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. nothing. It’s like when I took acid—I felt the
					wind brushing against my face although I knew I was in the bathroom and the door
					was closed. This was Mother Nature talking to me.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I would walk through the woods and walk and walk. I
					would find chestnut trees, fairy rings of mushrooms, bird’s nests made with
					human hair and fishing line. I would imagine I was in the jungle in Africa and
					climb up on the gates at the entrances to the big estates and sit on the stone
					lions (until someone shouted, “Get down from there, kid!”).</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">That’s where my spirit was born<span class="italic"
						>.</span> Of course I got introduced to spirituality through religion, too,
					from the Presbyterian Church in the Bronx and my choir teacher, Miss Ruth
					Lonshey. At the age of six, I learned all the hymns (and a few hers). I fell in
					love with two girls on either side of me in the choir. And of course they had to
					be twins. I remember being five and sitting next to my mother in a pew at that
					church, looking up at the altar that held the Bible and a beautiful golden
					chalice, with the minister looming over it. There was a golden tapestry that
					hung down to the floor with a crucifix embroidered on the front. I was all
					wrapped up in the tradition of getting up, sitting down, getting up, singing,
					sitting down, praying, singing, praying, getting up, praying, singing, and
					hoping all this would take me somewhere closer to heaven. I thought <span
						class="italic">for sure </span>God must be RIGHT THERE under THAT altar.
					Just as I’d thrown a blanket over the dining room chairs to create a fortress, a
					safe, powerful place, kinda churchlike, with the added bonus of imagination.
						WOW<span class="italic">, </span>all of this combined together in one
					beautiful moment of ME, feeling GOD. But then I’d met Her once before in the
					forest.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I would walk in Sunapee with a slingshot in my back
					pocket over the meadow and through the woods until I got lost .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
					and that’s when my adventure would begin. I would come upon giant trees so full
					of chestnuts that the branches would bend, bushes full of wild blackberries,
					raspberries, and chokecherries, acres of open fields full of wild strawberries
					in the grass—so much so that when I was mowing the lawn, it smelled like my
					mom’s homemade jam. I would find animal footprints, hawk feathers, fireflies,
					and mushrooms in the shape of Hobbit houses that I was told were left by Frodo
					and Arwin from <span class="italic">Lord of the Rings.</span> Incidentally,
					those were the same mushrooms that I would later eat and that would magically
					force my pen to write the lyrics to songs like “Sweet Emotion.” In choir, I was
					singing to God, but on mushrooms, God was singing to me.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I pretended I was a Lakota Indian with a bow and
					arrow—“One shot, one kill”—only I had my BB gun—“One BB, one bird.” Me and my
					imaginary buddy Chingachogook, moving silently through the woods. I was a
					deadeye shot; I’d come back after an afternoon of killing with my slingshot and
					Red Ryder BB gun with a string of blue jays tied to my belt. That part wasn’t
					imaginary. I had watched every spring how blue jays raided the nests of other
					birds and flew away with their babies. My uncle had told me that blue jays were
					carnivorous, just like hawks and lawyers.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I’d go out fishing with my dad on Lake Sunapee in a
					fourteen-foot, made-in-the-forties, very antique, <span class="italic">giant
					</span>wooden 270-pound rowboat that only a Viking could lift. The handles on
					the oars alone were thicker than Shaq at a urinal. You’re out in the&nbsp;center
					of the lake, sun beating down like in the Sahara. You’re burning, you can’t go
					any farther. By the time we rowed out to the middle, where the BIG ONES were
					biting, we all realized we had to row back. <span class="italic">We being ME.
						A-ha-ha-ha!</span> I became Popeye Tallarico. Mowing the lower forty acres
					once a week gave me the shoulders to row back to shore (and to carry the weight
					of the world).</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Up in the woods from the lake there were great
					granite boulders pushed there by glaciers during the Ice Age. There were caves
					up above the road I lived on in Sunapee with Indian markings on the
					walls—pictographs and signs. They were discovered when the town was settled back
					in the 1850s. The Pennacook Indians lived in those very caves. After killing off
					all the Indians, the whites built and named a seventy-five-room grand hotel
					after them, Indian Cave Lodge, the first of three grand hotels in the Sunapee
					area and the first place where I played drums with my dad’s band back in
					1964—also just a half a mile away from where I first saw Brad Whitford play.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">In the town of Sunapee Harbor there used to be a
					roller-skating rink. It had been an old barn; they opened up the door on the
					right side and the door on the left side and they poured cement around the
					outside of the barn so you could skate around the barn and through the middle
					out the other side. As a kid, it was a great little roller-skating rink. And
					back then, you could rent skates on the inside of the barn along the back wall
					and buy a soda pop, which they would put in cups that you could grab as you
					skated on by. Later on they put a little stage where a band could play behind
					where they rented the skates. By the next summer, not only could you
					roller-skate, but you could also rock ’n’ roller-skate to your favorite band. It
					was the first of its kind and it was called the Barn. Across the street was a
					restaurant called the Anchorage. You could pull your boat up and after a long
					day of waterskiing, sunbathing, or fishing-with-no-luck, get fish and chips.
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And speaking of chips, no one made french fries better than one
					of the cooks that worked at the Anchorage—Joe fucking Perry. I went back there
					to shake his hand and there he stood in all his glory, horn-rimmed black glasses
					with white tape in the middle holding them together. He looked like Buddy Holly
					in an apron. I said, “Hi, how are ya?” or was it, “How high are ya?” At the time
					I was with a band called the Chain Reaction—and little did I know that my future
					lay somewhere between the french fries and the tape that held his glasses
					together.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="sbdropcap">A</span>t the
					end of each summer I’d go back to the Bronx, which was a 180-degree culture
					shock. A return to the<span class="italic"> total </span>city—tenements,
					sidewalks—from <span class="italic">total </span>country—where the deer and the
					antelope rock ’n’ roam. Haven’t met many people who experienced that degree of
					transition. Where we lived was the equivalent of the projects: sirens, horns,
					garbage trucks, concrete jungle—versus the country—rotted-out Old Town canoe
					bottoms from the early 1900s, remnants from the last generation who once knew
					the original Indians. <span class="italic">Holy shift!</span> By September 1,
					all the tourists who made New Hampshire quiver and quake for a summer of fun had
					fled for the city from whence they came like migrating birds. Welcome to the
					season of wither. One was grass, green, and good old Mother Nature, and the
					other was cement sidewalks, subways, and switchblades. But somehow I still found
					a way to be a country boy, so even in the city I could be Mother Nature’s
					son—but with attitude.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Kids would ask me, “Where’d you go?” I’d tell them,
					“Sunapee!” Sunapee was a great mysterious Indian name. It was like coming from a
					different planet. When I got back to the city I would invent fantastic
					adventures for myself: escaping from a grizzly bear, attacked by Indians.
					“You’ve got a .22?” “You <span class="italic">what</span>?” And then I started
					the bullshit: “I got bit by a rattlesnake .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ,” showing them a scar
					I got falling into the fireplace that summer. It was kind of like believing your
					own lie; you tell a lie and it <span class="italic">grows</span>. “The thing
					came at me, it was drooling, it had blood on its fangs from the camper it’d
					recently killed.” “You’re <span class="italic">kidding</span> me?” “No,
					seriously, it was rabid, but I nailed it right between the eyes with my .22.”
					Well, I didn’t want to say I was mowing lawns and taking garbage to the dump.
					That didn’t cut it with the girls, or the guys who wanted to beat you up if you
					didn’t represent a Bronx-type attitude. I wanted to talk about how I killed a
					grizzly with my bare hands—I was Huck Finn from Hell’s Kitchen. City people have
					bizarre ideas about the country anyway, so I could make up anything I liked and
					they’d believe me. Remember, this was 1956. And Ward Cleaver actually had a son,
					not a wife, named .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Beaver.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-art-below" xml:lang="en-us">I was about nine when we moved from the Bronx to
					Yonkers. I <span class="italic">hated</span> being called Steve. I was known as
					Little Stevie to my family and that’s cool because that’s my family. But being
					called Steve by anyone other than my family sucked. Getting moved from the Bronx
					to a place called Yonkers (a name almost as bad as Steve) took a little
					adjusting to. It was too white and Republican for a skinny-ass punk from the
					Bronx. My best friend’s name was Ignacio and he told me to use my middle name,
					which is Victor, a-lika my poppa! This suggestion, coming from a kid whose name
					sounds like an Italian sausage, was perfect. So for a year everyone called me
					Victor and that’s just how long that lasted.</p>

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Moving from the Bronx to Yonkers was okay because
					we lived in a private house with a huge backyard and woods everywhere. There was
					a lake used as a reservoir two blocks from my house, where my friends and I
					fished our teenage years off. It was filled with frogs, salmon, perch, and every
					other kind of fish. There were skunks, snakes, rabbits, and deer in my backyard.
					There was so much wildlife in those woods that we all started trapping animals,
					skinning them, and selling their fur for pocket money, a kind of backwoods hobby
					I learned from the 4-H friends I grew up with in New Hampshire. When I was
					fifteen I found a toy store that sold wading pools for toddlers in the shape of
					a boat. I bought one and humped it down to the lake, paddled out and picked up
					all the lures that were caught in the weeds. I wound up selling them to the same
					people who had lost them to begin with. I was a reservoir dog before it was a
					movie.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">At fourteen I found this pamphlet in the back of
						<span class="italic">Boy’s Life</span> or some other wildlife magazine, with
					an ad for Thompson’s Wild Animal Farm in Florida. You could buy anything from a
					panther to a cobra to a tarantula to a raccoon. A baby raccoon? Wow, I gotta
					have one! I sent away and it arrived in a wooden crate looking up at me with
					eyes like a Keane painting or a Japanese anime schoolgirl. I gave him a bath,
					threw him over my shoulder, and headed down to the lake. It was there that <span
						class="italic">he</span> taught <span class="italic">me</span> how to fish
					all over again. I named him Bandit because when you turned your back he would
					either pick your pockets or steal all the food out of the refrigerator. After a
					year of his ripping the house apart, I realized that a wild animal kept in the
					house is not the same as having a domestic animal as a pet, so I had to keep him
					in the backyard. You’ve got to just feed them and let them be wild. If you take
					them in, they adopt your personality—and at age sixteen, I was full of piss ’n’
					vinegar, which is not what you want a wild animal to be. He ripped down every
					curtain my mom put up in the house. I loved Bandit and he changed my mind about
					killing animals. I wound up giving him away to a farmer in Maine where he grew
					to a ripe old age, huge and fat. Eventually chewing his way to freedom, he bit
					through an electric wire and burned down the barn. You can still see his face in
					Maine’s Most Wanted. Way to go, Bandit!</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Back in the Bronx, the kids would assemble in the
					courtyard every morning at good ’ol P.S. 81. “All right, class, line up!” at
					8:15 <span class="sc">A.M.</span> sharp. One morning when I was in third grade,
					there was a girl in the courtyard and I must have grabbed a broken lightbulb and
					chased her around—like any smart (ass) little boy looking for affection would
					do. This was <span class="italic">my</span> way of proving that there was more
					to adolescent courtship than snakes and snails and puppy dog tails.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Her mother went to the principal’s office. “If
					Steven Tallarico’s not thrown out of this school, I’m taking my daughter out! He
					chased my daughter with a LETHAL WEAPON (blah blah
					blah). He’s an animal!” I was already Peck’s Bad Boy, and this didn’t help. They
					brought my mom in. They wanted to send me to a school for wayward lads and
					lassies, who are known today as ADHD kids.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“What? Are you kidding?” my mother said to the
					principal. My mom was soooo <span class="italic">for</span> me. “You know what?
					I’m takin’ <span class="italic">him</span> out of this school. Fuck you!” She
					didn’t say that, but her EYES did. And she DID take me out. I moved on to the Hoffmann School, which
					was a private school in Riverdale hidden in the woods, oddly enough, by Carly
					Simon’s house. Unbeknownst to me, Carly also lived nearby in Riverdale. Thirty
					years later, when we did a concert toether on Martha’s Vineyard, she told me
					that she also went to the Hoffmann School.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I was excited about the Hoffmann School, but I get
					to the place and find out it’s full of “spaycial kids.” Kids that go “Fuck YOU!” in the middle of class, who have some Tourette-type
					syndrome and scream their lungs out. A little wilder than public school, I would
					say: kids sniffing the glue during art class and writing graffiti in the
					hallways .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. kids <span class="italic">eating</span> finger paint
					and everyone shooting spitballs with rubber bands at each other. WOW, my kind of place!</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">These were kids like me, hyper, acting-out
					kids—real brats! Not that I was that <span class="italic">exactly</span>. I just
					had too much Italian in me, the kind of Italian who, you know, is loud,
					opinionated, in-your-face, with no brakes. But I knew that if I totally let go,
					there was going to be fucking cause and effect and it would end with a ruler
					across my knuckles. Still, I’d do anything I could think of. I remember once
					combing my hair in the lunchroom with a fork! That time I got off easy; setting
					a fire in a trash can was a different story.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">So that was the Bronx, still somewhat wild. On my
					way to the Hoffmann School I cut through a field, jumping over a stone wall.
						<span class="italic">Over the river and through the woods</span>. There was
					a cherry tree that was so thick and fat, the size of an <span class="italic"
						>elm</span> tree, and when it bloomed it was like an explosion of pink and
					white petals, like a snowstorm. In summer it was loaded with cherries.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I’d go around behind the apartment buildings
					looking for stuff to get into. I found this big, beautiful pile of dirt, which
					later I realized was landfill from all the apartment buildings in that area. A
					ten-story mountain of dirt you had to climb as if you were scaling Mount
					Everest. A kid’s dream! To me that pile of dirt was a mountain—Mount Tallarico.
					“Let’s go climb the mountain,” I’d tell my friends. When you got to the top of
					it there was a whole <span class="italic">acre</span> of land with weeds and
					saplings—and praying mantis nests and all sorts of things that no one could get
					to. Of course I had to bring a praying mantis nest home. It looked like
					something from between my legs—all round, tight, wrinkly, and kinda figlike. I
					hid it in my top drawer because I thought it was so cool. I woke up two weeks
					later and my room was <span class="italic">full</span> of little baby praying
					mantises—thousands of them! They’d just infested the place, all over our bunk
					beds, blankets, pillows, on the walls, and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <span class="italic"
						>“Mom!”</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">We opened the windows, ran out, and closed the
					door. Needless to say, I slept on the living room couch for almost a week. When
					we finally went back in they were all gone.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">On the top of that mountain was a small tunnel that
					I’d seen but never explored. One day I crawled in a few feet, but it was dark
					and musty so I didn’t go too far. The older I got, the farther I’d go. Finally
					one day I was crawling back in there and I said to my friend, “Hold my feet!”
					Because as a kid all you’ve got in your mind is that it’s the rabbit hole, which
					I didn’t want to know anything about at that age. Later on, I paid the Cheshire
					Cat a million dollars to be my roommate! How strange that after we moved in
					together, he almost cost me my life.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I was being really cautious, wriggling farther and
					farther in, shining a flashlight as I went, with my friend holding my feet. And
					what do I find there but an old M1 rifle that someone had used to hold up a
					liquor store around the corner from 5610 Netherland Avenue. So I took the rifle
					and walked through the streets to my building with it over my shoulder like
					General Patton. And I thought, “Wow, look what I got! I can’t wait to show my
					mother.” She eventually called the police and told them where I found it. I was
					written up in the paper the next day and I had my fifteen minutes of fame. Quite
					a change for the kid who was always getting in trouble. Okay, I became a hero
					while trying to <span class="italic">make</span> trouble, but still
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a fabulous first.</p>

						class="italic">Spin and Marty</span>) in Sunapee, Joe Perry lived on the
					lake just six miles from me, over in The Cove. It was, like, all our lives as
					kids, he was there and I was there and we never ran into each other. We did the
					same stuff. He swam all day and lived in the water—and the lake water’s fucking
					freezing—any more than half an hour and your lips were purple. I’d get out of
					the water and lie on my stomach in the sand at Dewey Beach, stretching my arms
					out like wings and pulling the hot sand up to my chest, trying to warm up like a
					lizard on a rock. I can only imagine what my heart must have been doing, going
					through the hypothermia shuffle.</p>

							<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">But it wasn’t all purely idyllic up in
					Sunapee—there was racism, and we were Italian. The Cavicchio family used to put
					on water-ski shows in the harbor. They brought the show from Florida. They were
					the only ones who knew how to perform the water-ski jump, ski barefoot, and pull
					seven girls behind the boat, girls who would climb on each other’s shoulders to
					make a human pyramid. Then one day they took the docks away at Dewey Beach to
					drive the Cavicchios off. An era was over. Now, no one could go to Dewey Beach
					and water-ski off the dock. My uncle Ernie, however, had a different plan. He
					knew that once anybody learned how to water-ski, it was more fun starting with
					your ass sitting on the dock instead of in the cold water. So he built a
					nine-by-nine-foot raft, put barrels underneath to keep it afloat and four chains
					on the corners that went down to four rocks that anchored it to the bottom to
					keep it in place. Whoever tore the dock down couldn’t stop us, because the raft
					was far enough offshore that it wasn’t in anyone’s way. But someone got pissed
					that we had gone against the grain. One dark night they decided to take fat from
					the Fryolators at one of the harbor restaurants and smear it all over the top of
					the raft. It became so greasy and smelly that no one could or would want to
					water-ski off it. How odd is it that the fat from the Fryolator that Joe Perry
					used to make my french fries was the same shmutz that caused the first oil slick
					on Lake Sunapee? It was a countrified version of the <span class="italic">Exxon
						Valdez</span> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. only it tasted a bit better.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I would hitchhike from Trow-Rico down to Sunapee
					Harbor on Friday night and meet up with the guys in town. The thing to do was to
					find someone to buy us some beer; then we would play this game of jumping from
					boathouse to boathouse, just like roof jumping in New York, only in New
					Hampshire, on the lake. The rule was you weren’t allowed to touch land, and
					whoever made it to the farthest boathouse got the six-pack of Colt 45 and the
					girl that thought it was cool. Cheap thrills. The Anchorage Restaurant down at
					the harbor had three pinball machines that were lit up all night long,
					especially if Elyssa Jerett was there. Nick Jerett, her father, played clarinet
					in my dad’s band. She was the most beautiful girl in Sunapee—and she later
					married Joe Perry. But back at the Anchorage, she was going full tilt all night
					long—she was a Pinball Wizardess!</p>
				<p class="x1bm-art-below" xml:lang="en-us">My cabin up in Trow-Rico was tiny. It had a
					double-decker bunk bed, one bureau, and one window that pulled down with a
					chain. I slept on the top bunk, and in the morning my father would wake me up by
					throwing apples from the crabapple tree. Around 7:00 <span class="sc"
					>A.M</span>. If I’d gotten any sleep at all, it was rise and shine no matter
					what. He didn’t throw the apples hard, but it was loud enough to wake me up. The
					sound and the rhythm of the apples hitting the side of the cabin was a muffled
					kind of music to me, kind of like the backbeat of a snare drum—it always
					reminded me of how loud a snare should be in a track.</p>

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Dad knew I loved playing drums, so he offered me a
					job playing with his band three nights a week, all summer long. What his band
					played was kind of like the society music you hear in <span class="italic">The
						Great Gatsby</span> tradition. We played cha-chas, Viennese waltzes, fox
					trots, and show tunes from Broadway musicals, like “Summertime” from <span
						class="italic">Porgy and Bess</span>. I was mortified when girls my own age
					walked in, turned around, and walked out. I so wanted to go into a rockin’
					version of “Wipeout” or “Louie Louie,” instead of a waltz from Louis XIV, or so
					it seemed. We’d set up in the grand ballroom of the Lodge, and from 7:30 to
					10:00 <span class="sc">P.M</span>. we played four sets, each a half-hour long. I
					had to pull my long hair back, slick it down with pomade and butch wax, and put
					it in a ponytail. I looked like a fourteen-year-old Al Pacino in <span
						class="italic">Scarface</span>!</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I got two or three summers of that under my belt,
					playing every night for two months with my dad. The audience was older, but now
					and then some folks would bring in their daughters; it was a family affair. And
					while I was playing one night this good-looking girl in a white dress came in
					with her parents. I watched her from behind the drums, eyeing her up and down
					and fantasizing as little boys do. Her mother would look on while her father, of
					course, had the first dance with his little cherub. How cute! She had to be
					fourteen—plump, pubescent perfection, flashing her big green eyes, and hair down
					to her waist. “Oh, my god,” I thought, and overcome with teenage lust, I let my
					hair down, though it made my dad very angry. I wanted to let my FREAK FLAG FLY!
					I’m sure that hearing the songs we were playing, if she weren’t with her
					parents, any girl in her right mind would have been gone in two seconds! I could
					see her thinking, “<span class="italic">I’m so outta here!” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
					</span>and so was I! The chase was on! During the break, Dad was in the bar with
					the band and I was drooling in the hallway, looking for the cherub in the white
					dress.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-art-below" xml:lang="en-us">There was a guy named Pop Bevers who used to come
					and mow the fields when we got up to Trow-Rico in July. He chewed tobacco—big
					plug o’ Days Work. I’d sit and talk with him while he rolled his cigarettes and
					taught me how, too. I’d make my own cigarettes using corn silk. I’d put it on
					the stone wall, dry it out, roll it up in cigarette paper, and smoke it. Corn
					silk! I tried chewing tobacco once and got <span class="italic">so</span> sick I
					blew chunks all over my sister Lynda.</p>

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Then came the drinking years. All summer long my
					family would collect large quart bottles of Coke. My mom would save empty pop
					bottles, beer bottles, and wine jugs during the winter when we lived in the
					Bronx and Yonkers, and we’d bring <span class="italic">cases</span> of empty
					bottles up to Trow-Rico. At the end of the year, when the guests would leave, it
					would be apple season, and my entire family and I would go pick apples at an
					orchard and bring them to a place that pressed the fruit. We’d take the juice
					and put it into the bottles and keep them in the basement of Trow-Rico where
					they would turn into hard cider. One evening after a show at our barn (where we
					played every Saturday night), my cousin Auggie Mazella said, “C’mon, let’s go in
					the basement.” We grabbed a bottle and drank the whole thing out of the tin cups
					from our Army Navy surplus mess kits. The top of the kit became a frying pan in
					which you could cook your beans over a can of Sterno. It had a couple of plates,
					a cup, and silverware—the coolest thing.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">The hard cider was strong stuff. We drank it just
					like we were drinking apple juice, and with no clue that we were getting
					hammered fast. I stumbled into the barn where the band was jamming and began to
					entertain the startled guests in an altered state, one to which I would soon
					become well accustomed. The glow shortly wore off. I felt queasy, staggered
					outside, fell flat on my torso, and woke up with a mouthful of yard. I crawled
					back to my cabin. Had I learned my lesson? Yes! But not in the way you’d
					think.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">One night at the Soo Nipi Lodge my childhood ended.
					I went from sitting with Daddy in the bar, having a Coke and eating peanuts,
					headlong into the evil world of dope! I met some of the staff, the busboys who
					lived down in the bungalows. Went out there and somebody twisted up a joint.
					Now, back then, we’re talking 1961, a joint was <span class="italic"
					>thin</span>. They were <span class="italic">tiny. </span>Pot was <span
						class="italic">so</span> illegal I didn’t want to know about it. Another
					night I went into town to see a band at the Barn and one of the guys rolled a
					joint in the bathroom. He goes, “Hey, you want to smoke this?” “Nope,” I said.
					“I don’t need that! I got enough problems.” Plus I’d seen <span class="italic"
						>Reefer Madness,</span> so I passed it up, but then I got curious. I don’t
					know if was the smell or the romance, but eventually everything that I did was
					illegal, immoral, or fattening.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Shortly thereafter I started <span class="italic"
						>growing</span> pot, hiding it from the family—as if they would ever know
					what it was. I thought if I put it right there in the field, knowing my luck
					someone would probably mow it down. So I went up to the power lines and planted
					some seeds, thinking that maybe that was far enough away. I figured I could just
					go up there and water the plants whenever necessary. But first off, I took a
					fish—a perch that I’d caught in the lake—chopped it up in little pieces, and put
					it on the stone wall so the summer heat would ferment it. After two weeks, flies
					are buzzing around it. It’s rotten, just stinky! I mulched it with dirt, put it
					in the ground, took my pot seed, and went up and watered it every day. Two
					months later, I have a freakish bonsai of a pot plant. It’s had plenty of
					fertilizer, but for some reason it wasn’t growing. The stems were hard like
					wood. <span class="italic">What’s wrong?</span> I wondered. Maybe it was because
					New Hampshire’s cold at night—that’s it! Wrong. Turns out they’d sprayed DDT or
					some pesticide under the power lines that stunted the plant’s growth. Hey,
					motherfuckers! I was pulling leaves off and smoking it and getting high anyway.
					But the plant only had seven leaves on it. Still, I loved getting high and being
					in the woods. I would trip and go up to the mountains and streams with Debbie
					Benson—she was my dream fuck when I was fifteen.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I’d get high smoking pot with my friends in my
					cabin. We’d lock the door, even though I never had to hide my pot smoking from
					my mom. I’d say, “Mom, you’re drinking! Why don’t you smoke pot instead?” I’d
					twist one up and say, “Ma, see what it smells like?” She never said, “Put that
					out!” mainly because Mom loved her five o’clock cocktail (or the contact
					high).</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">When I couldn’t get a ride from Trow-Rico down to
					the harbor—which is what, four miles?—I walked. In New Hampshire at night in the
					woods, it was so dark, you couldn’t see your hand in front of your face. All
					those terrifying stories I’d told to my friends back in the Bronx came teeming
					to life. Wolf packs! Black widow spiders! Silhouettes of the Boston Strangler!
					Blood-thirsty Indians! I knew there weren’t any Indian tribes left up at
					Sunapee. We—the white man—had wiped them out. But what about the <span
						class="italic">ghosts</span> of the Indians? They would be really pissed
					off, rabid with unquenchable bloodlust. Or else I was trippin’ on my mom’s
					homemade hard cider.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">When clouds went over the moon the road got pitch
					black and I went, “Oh, shit!” I tapped my way with a stick like Blind Pew from
						<span class="italic">Treasure Island</span>. Really lonely .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
					and scary. Yonkers and the Bronx were always lit up. You could hide in the
					snowbanks and when a car came around the corner you could grab on to the bumper
					and ski along behind it. But in Sunapee I almost had to crawl on my hands and
					knees to follow the white line down the middle of a dark country road. Later on
					I’d be back on my hands and knees following another kind of white line down a
					different dark road.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">When I lived up there and September came and
					everybody was gone, I’d feel abandoned. Rough stuff when you’re young. I used to
					think, am I going to be that crotchety old fuck yelling at kids to get off of my
					lawn? No, that’s not me. I was the kid pissing on the lawn. You know, at this
					point in my life, I’m still in the woods. There’s still so much I’m not sure of,
					and I kinda like that. It’s the fear that drives us.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“Seasons of Wither” comes from the angst and
					loneliness of those nights when I was walking down that spooky road.</p>
				<p class="x1song-first" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">Fireflies dance in the

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Now something new entered my life, less scary in
					one way but in another, more terrifying since it involved girls—that was long
					before I figured women out. “Right, Steven. You never did figure them out, did
					you? Just became a rock star and that sort of solved the problem.” Ya think?</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Anyway, my cousin Augie and I had talked these two
					girls into going camping overnight with us. Two girls, a tent,
					day-gives-way-to-night, booze. Oh, man, you never know what could happen with
					that scenario. We could get lucky.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We came to a beautiful,
					rolling hill. It looked so plush and soft at night: “Wow! Where are we?” “I
					don’t know, man, but let’s pitch the tent and, uh, heh-heh, y’know.
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” We had a six-pack of beer, girls, what could be bad? I don’t
					think we were doing the wild thing, but definitely making out and getting drunk.
					I wish I’d had the evil mind back then that I have now—but when you’re a boy
					you’re mortally afraid of girls! Terrified!</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">We wake up in the morning to someone shouting,
						“<span class="italic">Four! </span>” I will never forget that. We looked at
					each other. What does that mean? <span class="italic">Four?</span> Louder this
					time, and then a golf ball slams into the side of the tent. Oh, “Fore!<span
						class="italic">” </span>We’d pitched the tent on the third hole on the golf
					course. Naked and hungover, we grabbed our stuff and ran like hell.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="sbdropcap">W</span>hen I
					was six or seven, I went to church and sang hymns. There was a table with
					candles on it, and I thought God lived under that table. I thought that through
					the power of song, God was there. It was the energy rolling through those hymns.
					When I first heard rock ’n’ roll—what did it do to me? God .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
					before I had sex, it <span class="italic">was</span> sex! The first song that
					went directly into my bloodstream was “All for the Love of a Girl.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Way before the Beatles and the Brit Invasion, when
					I was nine or ten, I got a little AM radio. But at night up in Sunapee, the wind
					howled and I couldn’t get the radio stations I wanted, so I ran a wire up to the
					top of the apple tree. It’s still there! And I picked up WOWO out of Fort Wayne,
					Indiana, and heard <span class="italic">“</span>All for the Love of a Girl.<span
						class="italic">” </span>It was the B-side of Johnny Horton’s “Battle of New
					Orleans.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">“</span>All for the Love of a
					Girl” was a slow pick-and-strum love song with Johnny Horton, curling his lips
					around the lyrics, twanging each word as if it were a guitar string.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">It was very basic, almost the archetypal love song.
					It’s kind of an <span class="italic">every-love-song-ever-written</span> ballad.
					It’s <span class="italic">all there</span> in four lines. Bliss! Heartbreak!
					Loneliness! Despair! I sat in the apple tree and lived every line of it. The
					only thing missing was my <span class="italic">raging schooner</span>—the likes
					of which you could pup a tent with.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">When I heard the Everly Brothers’ “I Wonder If I
					Care as Much” and those double harmonies .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I lost my breath! No
					one ever did that anguished teen love song better than the Everly Brothers.
					“Cathy’s Clown,” “Let It Be Me,” “So Sad (to Watch Good Love Go Bad),” “When
					Will I Be Loved?” Oh, man, those heartrending Appalachian harmonies! Those
					harmonic <span class="italic">fifths</span>! I mean, God lives in the fifths,
					and anyone who can sing harmonies like that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that’s as close to
					God as we’re gonna get short of a mother giving birth. Behold the act of
					Creation .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. divine and perfect.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">If you have any doubts, try this: Take a deep
					breath and hold one note with somebody—a friend, your main squeeze, your parole
					officer: <span class="italic">“Ahhh.”</span> When two people hold the same note
					and one person goes slightly off that note you’ll hear an eerie vibration—it’s
					an unearthly sound. I think in those vibrations there exist very strong healing
					powers, not unlike the mysterious stuff the ancient shamans understood and
					used.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Now sing in fifths, one sing a C and the other a G.
					Then one of you goes off key .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that’s <span class="italic"

					fifiths there’s a magical throb. If you close your eyes and you touch foreheads,
					you’ll feel a wild interplanetary vibration. It’s a little-known secret, but
					that’s how piano tuners tune a Steinway.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">God and sound and sex and the electric world
					grid—it’s all connected. It’s pumping through your bloodstream. God is in the
					gaps between the synapses. Vibrating, pullulating, pulsating. That’s Eternity,
					baby.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">The whole planet is singing its weird cosmic dirge.
					The rotation of the earth resonates a great, terrible rumbling, grumbling
					G-flat. You can actually hear the earth groan like Howlin’ Wolf. DNA and RNA

					earth’s rotation.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">It all really <span class="italic">is</span>
					cosmic, man! Music of the fucking spheres! The third rock from the sun is one
					big megasonic piezoelectric circuit, humming, buzzing, drizzling with freak
					noise and harmony. The earth’s upper atmosphere is wailing for its baby in
					ear-piercing screeches, chirps, and whistles (where charged particles from the
					solar wind—the sun’s psychic pellets—collide with Mother Earth’s magnetic
					field). Earth blues! Maybe some shortwave-surfing extraterrestrial out there
					listening through his antenna will hear our cosmic moan.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">You can just about guess that anything can—is
					gonna—happen, so long as we stay here on earth. In a Stratocaster, say, you use
					a pickup wrapped with a few thousand coils of copper wire to amplify the sound
					of the strings. The vibration of the nearby strings modulates the magnetic flux
					and the signal is fed into an amplifier, which intensifies that frequency—and
					blasts out into the arena. In the same way that you can take a note and amplify
					it, you could amplify the whole fucking planet. Planet Waves!</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Take a compass. It’s just a needle floating on the
					surface of oil that’s not allowed to float freely. The power holding that needle
					is magnetism. The needle is quivering, picking up the slightest frequencies.
					Now, if you could amplify that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In thirty years, they’re gonna be
					able to do that, and I’ll have been sitting here going, “You know, there’s power
					in the needle of a compass and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” It’s actually a magnetic grid,
					the earth, so if you could amplify the magnetic frequencies of a guitar string,
					you could <span class="italic">certainly</span> amplify the magnetic frequencies
					of earth and <span class="italic">beam</span>
					<span class="italic">it</span>
					<span class="italic">out there</span> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Then you’d have the

				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="sbdropcap">R</span>ight
					outside my house in Sunapee there’s a big rock that my kids used to call
					“Sally.” It was their favorite thing to climb ’cause it was big and menacing and
					it drew them in. I had a special mystic boulder, too, but I never named my rock.
					It was right behind Poppa’s cabin. It’s probably thirty feet around and seven
					feet high, its surface so slick and smooth you can’t get a grip to climb it. But
					next to this rock was a tree, and using the tree I leveraged myself up and onto
					the top of the rock. I thought, “If I can get on this rock and stand where no
					other human has ever stood .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I can communicate with aliens.” This
					raised some eyebrows among the other eight-year-olds on the playground.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">When I scaled the boulder, my first thought was
