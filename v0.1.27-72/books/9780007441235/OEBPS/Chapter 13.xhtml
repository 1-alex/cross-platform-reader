				<p class="x1chap-ttl" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="bold">Trouble in Paradise
					<br />(Losing Your Grip <br />on the Life Fantastic)</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm-first" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="dropcap">B</span>y the fall of
					’91 I had six years’ sobriety, but, for whatever reason, I wasn’t getting along
					with my band. I’m Italian, I really look at what’s going on. So I thought I
					better go check in someplace and get this sorted out.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Around that time, Marko Hudson was working on a
					Ringo album and put me on the phone with him—never mind the fact that it was the
					first time I’d ever spoken with Ringo, one of my heroes (an actual Beatle), and
					to say the least I was beside myself. Mark had told me the day before that Ringo
					had just come out of rehab and was sober. So, I got on the phone.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“Richard,” I said, “I’ve been butting heads with my
					band for just about every fucking album we’ve done.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“I can relate to that,” he said.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I thought to myself, if I’m having problems with my
					bandmates and you’re in the Beatles, I can only imagine what you went through.
					The funny part is that we spoke for almost an hour about all this stuff and he
					ends by saying, “Well, good luck man .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. enjoy your sobriety.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“What do you mean, ‘sobriety,’ ” I said to him.
					“I’ve been sober for six years—I thought you knew. Didn’t Marko tell you?”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“Well, what the fuck are you going <span
						class="italic">there</span> for?” he said, meaning rehab.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“I want to make peace with my bandmates,” I said,
					“so we can write like we did in the old days. I’m following the old adage that
					you can attract more flies with honey than vinegar. The only problem is who is
					the honey and who is the vinegar?”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">So off I trekked to Arizon-i-a and checked into
					Sierra fucking Tucson (for codependency) to try and find out what the problem
					was. Now then, how to juggle band and family at the same time? <span
						class="italic">Mmmmmnh!</span> I wanted to see why my relationship with the
					band was so fucked .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. so up and down .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and not in a
					good way. In part it was because of something I hadn’t yet grasped—and wouldn’t
					for many years to come: that Tim Collins and Joe Perry had been in bed together
					micromanaging the band since Day One. I would tell Joe something and he would
					tell Tim, and in many instances by the time it got back to me, it was the exact
					opposite. It was a triangulated version of the telephone game. Say Tim had it in
					his head for some reason to want to do something, but instead of working it out
					between us he would call Joe and tell him I was out of control—and then call me
					and tell me Joe was out of control. Since Joe and I were now not speaking to
					each other Tim could tell the band that Joe and I were fighting. All this
					happened in the middle of a yearlong world tour for the album <span
						class="italic">Get a Grip</span>—talk about “Livin’ on the Edge”
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. WTF! But that’s how it was—and obviously not just in this band.
					How about Keith and Mick, Dave and Ray Davies, Jimmy Page and Robert Plant, and
					John and Paul. How is it that the best of us can be so manipulated? Fuck, we did
					turn out like our heroes, but not in the way we thought. Joe and Tim were to
					Aerosmith what the world percieved John and Yoko to be to the Beatles—without a
					doubt. What with the band members, the wives, and the managers .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
					all in bed together. Talk about fucked. That’s the heroin of it all! To find out
					that we’d spent years turning reality into a dream and watching it turn into a
					nightmare. <span class="italic">That’s</span> death by heroin.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I spent three weeks at Sierra Tucson, a
					multipurpose attitude-reconditioning facility or whatever. First day I’m there
					the therapist asks me, “So, uh, Steven, we start with some questions: Ever had
					an outside affair?” “Well, yes I—” “Okay, send him to sexual therapy. Next, have
					you ever had a member of your family die when you weren’t there?” “Well, you
					see, my grandmother—” “Grief counseling!’’ “Have you ever had problems at home
					with your wife and children?” “Well, see, I’m often on the road for months at a
					time and don’t see—” “Family orientation group.” After I left there, I had six
					or seven isms hung around my neck: drug addict, alcoholic, sex addict,
					codependent, family concerns, anger management, rhino clit, dwarf cock, whale
					watcher, bee keeper, oh, and did I mentin compulsive narcissism? Oh yeah, I had
					a full range of life issues. The bad news: how did they know? The good news: the
					last week of any stint in rehab, you have what’s called family week, and as I
					have two families—my biological family and that other one .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the
					band .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. guess who came to dinner?</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Of course, there’s all these therapists with their
					fucking theories. John and Yoko went to Arthur Janov for scream therapy. Let’s
					see, if people scream when they’re really scared, what if .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No,
					no, wait! What if we get them to scream indoors when they’re <span
						class="italic">not </span>scared? That way, maybe they won’t scream when
					they <span class="italic">do</span> get scared—and we’ll have invented a <span
						class="italic">new emotion</span>! Yes! That’s it! Hungry, angry, lonely,
					and Janov!</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">It took me a good three weeks to get any love from
					the counselors who were constantly trying to label me and figure me out
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to make me recognize shame—feel <span class="italic">bad</span>
					about my bad self. They said leave Steven Tyler outside and bring Steven
					Tallarico inside. And never the twain shall meet? As fucking <span
						class="italic">if </span>! They tried to make me wear my clothes—in disarray
					as they said—inside out and put a patch on me that said “No talking to females.”
					All that did was attract the freaks. He was a bold man who ate the first oyster,
					and they were about to get to know him real well. Meanwhile I’m still waiting
					for <span class="italic">that</span> counselor to tell it like it is. So, on
					family day we (the band, plus management) go around the room and then they get
					to Bob Dowd, who was hired by management primarily as a “drug cop” to keep the
					band sober (imagine that). This guy was a <span class="italic">real</span>
					Nevada trooper who knew little about human interaction and nothing about rock
					stars’ evil ways. And Tim goes and makes him Aerosmith’s fucking tour
					manager?!?! Bob would sit with us, keeping an eye on us while Joe and I were
					trying to write songs. I’d say, “You know, Bob, we don’t write so good with
					people watching us. You’re blowing the vibe.” Of course, that would be
					translated into, “Steven’s causing trouble; he wants me out—he must want to do
					drugs.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">So at the session I laid into him, “I don’t
					appreciate you following us around like a cop. Stay out of it. Besides,” I
					mumbled to myself, “your arm’s too short to box with God, and you don’t know
					anything about addiction!” Tim, in Bob’s defense, looked at the counselors, and
					said, “I hired him to make sure no one was using, leave him alone. And, by the
					way, that’s the way it’s gonna be.” The counselors looked at Tim in astonishment
					and said, “You may be the sickest one here.” The tension was beyond belief.
					That’s when I screamed, “Halle-fuckin-lullah!” I took some boxes and pushed ’em
					together in the middle of the floor of this room of mucho agidacion. I grabbed
					my giant scarf from the corner of the room and threw it over the boxes and said,
					“From here on out I dub thee the Shroud of Touring, and we shall take it with us
					as a good luck sign to never forget this moment.” And with that, I grabbed my
					coffee cup, poured it into a goblet, and made a toast to the band: “Here’s to
					hell .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. may we have as much fun there as we had getting there.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">The manipulation never stopped with personal
					management, money management, and the addiction counselors. One day after the
					Tucson incident, and neck deep in the <span class="italic">Get a Grip
					</span>album, they all came to my house (and wouldn’t you know these cretins all
					came from the Malibu Home for the Recently Alright). Apparently they had
					concerns about the way the album process was going. They said, “Look, we feel
					you’re really not writing the way you did before. So, we think, you know, it
					would really be all right to get a blow job once in a while.” These were words
					of wisdom coming from the total Aerosmith management package.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">And I said, “Wow! That’s great, you guys. So, does
					that mean you’ll bring me a beer once in a while, too—and which one of you guys
					are gonna blow me right now? Don’t you know one drink is much too many
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and a million’s not enough? Let’s see, do I want to be a dancing
					bear here? Do I want to give up that easy? Do I really want to keep the right
					ones out and the wrong ones in? Or do I want the world to think that I’m
					mysterious and dark and that I get my lyrics from the De-vil’s Den? Hmmm, let me
					think.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="sbdropcap">I</span>n 1992
					we were recording <span class="italic">Get a Grip</span> with the band. I was
					working on “Fever” with Joe when I hit on one of the best lyrics I think I’ve
					ever written. I was so proud of it and thought it was so funny that I brought it
					to the band with such a frog-eating grin that Tom said, “What’s the matter? What
					do ya got?” And so I said, “Check that shit out.”</p>
				<p class="x1song-first" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">The buzz that you be
						gettin’ from the crack don’t last</span></p>
				<p class="x1song-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">I’d rather be O’Din’ on
						the crack o’ your ass.</span></p>
				<p class="x1song-last" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">Yeah, we’re all here,
						’cause we’re not all there tonight</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Silence .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. crickets .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a
					blank look and then Tom turns to me and says, “Are you gonna sing that lyric on
					the song?” “Excuse me?” I knew where he was going with that because he’s hit me
					with that same type of sideways getting-into-something shit before.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“Steven, I was just, um, wondering
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“What, man, what?” Knowing the other shoe was going
					to drop. “Well, just fucking say it, will ya?”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">And Tom says, “That’s not going on my album.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“That’s one of my favorite lines of all time, Tom.
					And by the fucking way, what do you mean ‘that’s not going on my album’? I wrote
					the fucking song, not you. If it wasn’t for this internal mental fucking
					backwash I wouldn’t have the inspiration to write the next song,” I said.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">If I could have bottled the anger I felt in that
					moment I would have quit the band and bought Madrid, and hung out with the
					lemurs for the rest of my life.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Oh well, and speaking of anger, when you get into
					bed with A&amp;R men .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that all-time adage is so true: can’t live
					with ’em, can’t live without ’em! Or maybe it’s, “If you lie down with dogs
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” Nah .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but do they really do a band good? Did the
					infamous A&amp;R diva, John Kalodner John Kalodner, really help us out? He
					insisted that every time his name was put on the back of an album it be written
					twice. I guess he subscribed to my point of view that anything worth doing is
					worth overdoing. Actually it was a good luck thing in the end. And so I think
					the best thing John Kalodner John Kalodner ever did was to challenge us, to
					bring us around as real songwriters. The truth to the secret success of our
					marriage was that we let him in to begin with. Saying fuck it, just try it, that
					was my credo (okay, maybe some Tibetan monk living in a cave with yak butter in
					his hair said it first).</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Kalodner’s input as far as what a song should be
					and where songs should go was antiquated but all the same very effective. But
					his instincts were godlike. What he did do, however, was say in his nasal whine,
					“Steven, that’s great! Don’t bore us—get to the chorus. And it’ll be a hit
					single if you put strings on it.” Kind-a-like, if a tree falls in the woods and
					there’s no one there to hear it, does it still make a sound? And would that hit
					be a single? Or if a man has an opinion and a woman’s not there to hear it, is
					he still wrong? Yeah, I like that better.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Sometimes Kalodner would hear different choruses
					after songs were already written. Once, when we were out of songs for <span
						class="italic">Permanent Vacation,</span> I grabbed the guitar and started
					playing the riff to “St. John,” which at the time was a shell just waiting to be
					filled in. “That’s fucking great,” Kalodner says, “your instincts are right. You
					always write the best songs under last minute pressure.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Of course, I hated hearing him say that, but it was
					true.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I was in Vancouver in a hotel room by myself,
					gnawing the furniture, trying to come up with songs for <span class="italic">Get
						a Grip</span>. John Kalodner didn’t like the lyrics to “Cryin’ ” and for a
					month the walls of my room were covered with Scotch tape and scraps of
						paper—<span class="italic">covered</span>. I rewrote the lyrics to that song
					till I tore a hole in my brain—three, four times—and after the month I went,
					“Fuck it! I’m singing the original lyrics.”</p>
				<p class="x1song-first" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">There was a
						time</span></p>
				<p class="x1song-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">When I was so

				<p class="x1song-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">Love wasn’t much of a

						class="italic">what</span> the fuck I sing if it ain’t got that thing. I

				<p class="x1bm-2lspa" xml:lang="en-us">.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but he was looking for

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">When he called me unreasonable, I always rubbed it

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">You can ruin anything by overintellectualizing it.
					I want my lyrics coming straight at you—I don’t want everything explained,
					rationalized, sanitized, and homogenized. I’m writing “Deuces Are Wild” and
					Kalodner the fucking momaluke says, “What are deuces? No one plays cards
					anymore.” He was right (back then, before TV poker became all the rage in the
					2000s) .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but deuces, when I’m done with them, are sonic dice. I’ll
					make those bones dance.</p>
				<p class="x1song-first" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">I love you ’cause your

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">It had nothing to do with deuces .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it
					had everything to do with gambling as a metaphor for love, betting everything on

					“Deuces Are Wild” is on the side of the fastest funny car in the world. Do they
					look at it and go, “Huh? What does that mean?” They’d know what it means: deuces
					are wild, the car’s fucking fast. So what? If a girl came out naked and she had
					e = mc<span class="superscript">2</span> on her tits, do you think no one would

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Salieri in the film <span class="italic"
						>Amadeus</span>—that fucking prick! You know who he really was? Mozart’s
					A&amp;R man! Salieri the sycophant .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. who agrees with Emperor
					Joseph II, who agrees with the Music Director that there are “just too many
					notes” in Mozart’s opera. A&amp;R men, that’s the way they talk: “Start with
					this.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” “Put that in there!” The critics, too, can drive me
					crazy.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Their style of dissecting things rubs me the wrong

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Lawyers were brought into the folds of the band to

					fans, what’s the problem?</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“Just don’t talk to that person if you sense

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">And then Joe and Billie started having stalkers,
					and then came the beginning of the end.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Here’s a case in point: I’m vacationing at my
					summer home with all my kids for the first time. I’m cooking breakfast, and I
					see someone jump over my fence. My ex-wife, Teresa, says, “I’ll take care of
					this,” and starts walking toward the door. And I say, “No, you don’t, I got this
					one.” So, this guy is standing at my backdoor pushing the doorbell. I said,
					“Ehh, what’s going on here? What are you doing jumping over my fence? This is
					the last place I can go to get away from people like you. You could get shot
					jumping over my fence like that. What are you doing here?”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“Well, my mother said you wrote a song about me.”
					Looking in his eyes, I could tell he was on something or off his meds. I was
					standing close enough to see his hands so I’d be able to stop him if he went to
					grab for something.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I said, “I write a lot of songs about a lot of
					people. How do you know this one’s to you?”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“Well, you sang, <span class="italic">Tommy now
						it’s untrue</span>.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">And I went blank. “Tommy? No, no, it’s actually
					‘tell me,’ but it could be Tommy. Yeah, if you want it to be Tommy, it could be
					Tommy.” I didn’t correct him. I asked him, “Where’s your mom?”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“Well, she died when I was three. She left a note
					to me in a letter.” So that was his connection with the mother—I’m not going to
					take that away from him.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">So, I said, “As far as I’m concerned, it’s ‘Tommy.’
					From here on out, I’m gonna sing it like that. Now get outta here!” with a wink,
					“and don’t ever climb over the fence again.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I could have called the cops, but I diffused it
					myself. Half the people in the world who hear your music own it anyway. And it’s
					exactly what you want them to do.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Marko Hudson told me a story about when he was
					hanging out with John Lennon and the Hollywood Vampires during the <span
						class="italic">Walls and Bridges/</span>May Pang Kotex-on-the-head moment in
					1973. You gotta see this picture: Marko buzzing around Lennon’s hive (me thinks
					a bit too much). Lennon let Marko ask him ONE question about the Beatles, so he
					asks John about the lyric from “Happiness Is a Warm Gun.” “The image of the
					velvet hand and the lizard—it meant so much to me,” said Marko. “Can you tell me
					where it came from and what it means?” Lennon, Marko’s greatest hero in life,
					replies (imagine thick Liverpudlian accent), “Doesn’t mean nothin’. Sounds good
					comin’ off me tongue. I just write the words .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you make up the
					meaning.” My best friend was both crushed and liberated. But it points back to
					interpretation. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">People ask me all these questions about “Dream
						On<span class="italic">.</span>” “What does it mean?” What do you mean,
					“What does it mean?” It means Dream On. You figure it out. You’re the one
					listening to it .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. make up your own meaning.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="sbdropcap">W</span>hile I
					was working on <span class="italic">Nine Lives </span>I was clean and sober, I
					was high on life, but Tim Collins was convinced I was using. How could I be that
					jacked and on the natch? I think Tim wanted to catch me doing drugs in the worst
					way.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I went to Tim Collins’s office. I could tell by the
					smell of sulfur in the room that he was working on something diabolical, the
					monster. Dark deeds were afoot. “Steven, we’re going to send you to a retreat in
					Big Sur for a week, we think it’ll do you good.” Whenever I hear that
					something’s for my own good—<span class="italic">brrraaaannnng!</span>—alarms go
					off in my brain.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“I’m gonna go to a retreat in Big Sur? With
					who?”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“A men’s group from New York—all professional guys,
					captains of industry—you’ll get on with them famously,” Bob Timmons, Tim’s
					weaselly minion, chimed in.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“Oh, that sounds like Fun,” I said. “It’ll be five
					minutes of silence and the rest of the week it’s going be, ‘Uh, dude, man, what
					was it like singing “Dream On,” man?’ Or, ‘I gotta tell ya something, man, I got
					laid to your fucking records last week.’ ”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">You know what that would be like for me at sixty
					with another bunch of sixty-fucking-year-olds? “Do you know that my wife and I
					made love to your song and we got seven good children out of it.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">That marked the beginning of my communication
					breakdown with Tim Collins. In my head I was going, <span class="italic"
						>Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-dun-da-DA-na-na-na-na-na</span>. Ha! I was covering
					my ears so I couldn’t hear this crap. There was no way in hell I was going. Taj
					was four and Chelsea was eight. And it was hard enough being away from them for
					so long, but to come back from making a record and go to a fucking men’s club in
					Big Sur! With a bunch of, you know, sober testosterones? Bad enough going to a
					fucking bar and talking to those guys! Sober it’s ten times worse! They’re going
					to remember every epiphanous moment they had in their teenage years when they
					were watching porn, getting stoned, and listening to “Sweet Emotion” while
					fingering the girl next door.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“I’m not going, you fucks!” I said. “I just got
					back from finishing a fucking record—and it turned out great, by the way, thanks
					for asking.” They’ll tell you they were only <span class="italic"
						>suggesting</span> I go, but it’s like the Pope suggesting to the Boston
					cardinal that he better change the subject matter of his sermons or he’s going
					to go away for a year to a retreat in the Azores! Because when I objected, Bob
					Timmons said, “No, you have to go, we’ve already booked it.” And the sleazy duo
					started trying to talk me into it. I got really angry. “I haven’t seen my wife
					in over two months. What are you guys thinking of? Enough of your fucking
					control issues! Wait a fucking minute—it wasn’t all that long ago, back when I
					was in Tucson, Arizona, that you were telling me I could get a blow job. And now
					you’re telling me that I should go away? For <span class="italic">what</span>?”
					I said, “Fuck you! I’m not going there.” I walked out and slammed the door.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Now, keep in mind, this is a guy that helped
					massage and facilitate our sobriety. He was a strong advocate for us, but all
					along he was taking sleeping pills, anxiety medication (necessary apparently
					because he’s managing Aerosmith!), and binge eating. He’s up in his hotel room
					eating cheeseburgers, there’s three main entrees on the room service trolley.
					That’s a drug, too.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Still, I intended never to return. The era was
					over. He knew it. So he gathered the band to Boston, in the basement situation
					room, for an emergency meeting and told them, “Steven’s out of his mind. We
					gotta get his wife on the phone.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">He went upstairs and proceeded to call my wife.
					Pure vindictive crap. Joe was shocked that he’d actually done it. He said, “You
					did <span class="italic">what </span>? What the fuck?!?!”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Actually I was almost a year sexually sober, so if
					they told me to go fuck myself I couldn’t even have done that. All this while
					Sly Stallone was trying to hook me up with the most lascivious, sweetly sweaty,
					Floridian pulchritude known to man. I would go to clubs three times a week with
					him. Girls all over the place, boobs and thongs just like in <span
						class="italic">Girls Gone Wild. </span>Everywhere. The most I would do is
					say good night to them. “You’re leavin’ us, baby?” “Well, ladies, you can walk
					me back to the hotel if you like.” “Okay!” And three or four of them would walk
					me to the corner across the street from the main entrance of the Marlin Hotel. I
					would say, “Okay, girls, you have to stay here. I’m going in there alone. So I
					can get back to writing lyrics to stories yet untold.” A saint, I tell you.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">After leaving Tim’s office I stomped out the door
					and drove to Sunapee to open up the house for my kids, wipe the flies out of the
					windows—my favorite thing to do. On the way back to Boston I stopped at a
					tollbooth, pulled over, and called Teresa. She was crying hysterically. “Baby,
					tell me.” I said, “Why are you crying?” “Well, I’ll tell you why,” she said.
					“Tim called and told me you were fucking other girls and you’re still on drugs,
					and that’s why you went up to New Hampshire alone.” That’s how good he was—those
					devious little details! She just freaked. He had her on the phone for twenty
					minutes, screaming at Teresa. I had been married to her for eighteen years by
					then.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">When I hung up the phone with Teresa, I called
					Bobby Hearn (my sponsor in AA). I said, “Bobby, you better meet me at my house
					in Marshfield and get rid of all the guns or I’m gonna fucking get my gun and
					shoot Tim Collins. I am so fucking furious!” I mean, I totally went off! I don’t
					allow myself to get into that state anymore ’cause there’s no one in my life I
					let do that to me.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Now I had to deal with my wife. It took me two
					weeks, every day, to get rid of the anger.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Tim called the band into the office after I said it
					was over. Joe and I had been writing songs without them, so the guys in the band
					were already angry at me and this gave Tim the power to get the rest of the band
					on his side.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">The next day, I walked into our rehearsal space and
					said to my partner, Joe, “You fuck! Why didn’t you ask me if I was high? Like we
					used to talk in the early days.” Oh! See how angry I get now just thinking about
					it? Wait, it gets better!</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">When I saw the guys in the band again, I asked
					them, “What were you guys thinking when you let Tim call my wife? All this stuff
					he told you, it’s all just fucking hearsay from some friend of Tim’s.” And it
					was all particularly galling because it was one of the few times in my life that
					I was not drinking, was drug free, and sexually abstinent.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">When I asked the band why they believed I was
					fucking everything that moved they said. “Oh, Steven! What did we know? Tim
					convinced us. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“Fuck you! What if I called up your wife and said,
					‘He’s fucking this chick in his tiki hut?’ ”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Tim Collins would get people going with his
					insinuating little sayings like, “There’s trouble in paradise.” That’s the
					fucking letter he wrote to my wife. <span class="italic">Trouble in
						Paradise</span>. Tim Collins was famous for starting rumors, stuff that he
					made up himself. He was the fireman who sets the fires. He would go to Joe
					Perry’s house, light a fire at night when no one was looking, go back to the
					firehouse, wait for the alarm, rush over there, really quick, quicker than any
					other fireman, and put the fire out. So he could be a hero. He did that time and
					time again. And then when the fire was out, he’d say, “I saved your life.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">The very next day he went up to Sony with Bob
					Timmons to see the president. “So, Tim,” Donnie Ienner asks, “you’re telling me
					Steven’s back on heroin?”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">No hesitation. “Yup. But don’t worry, sir, I’m
					gonna get him back into rehab, and in a month or two, he’ll be all right again.
					I’ll get him in the studio, do an album, and everything’ll be fine. Goddamn him!
					I tried!”</p>
				<p class="x1bm-art-below" xml:lang="en-us">Oh, and it doesn’t stop there! Then he
					went to <span class="italic">Time</span> magazine and <span class="italic"
						>People </span>and <span class="italic">Rolling Stone</span>. “Aerosmith
					Lead Singer Back on Heroin!”</p>
				<p class="art-1" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="generated-style-2"><img

						 /></span></p>
				<p class="captions" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="caption-drop-cap">J</span>oe Perry, Tony Bennett, me, and Tommy Mottola
					the day we signed with Sony, 1991. (Kevin Mazur/WireImage/Getty Images)</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Shortly after this I’m out to dinner with Ienner at
					an Italian restaurant eating capozzelli di agnelli. Capozzelli, that’s a dish of
					lamb’s head. They bring the whole head out after it’s been in the oven. I’m
					sitting at the table and I said, “Did Tim and fuckin’ Bob Timmons come down here
					and tell you I was on heroin?” And he got quiet and he goes, “That’s exactly
					what they said.” “And you believed him?” “Well, now, Steven, I don’t want to
					cause any trouble here.” I said, “Don’t worry about that. We just fired him.”
					“Well, to be honest with you, I was thinking this was a little fucked.” “Oh,
					really? A minute ago you wouldn’t say anything because you didn’t want to start
					any trouble.” “Well, Stevie, ya see, I’m one of those people that—” Oh, fuck you
					and the horse you rode in on!</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">While all this was going on my daughter Mia called
					me up crying. She goes, “Daddy, I’m so scared! Are you on drugs again?” I was
					stunned to hear her so upset; Mia never cries. I took her out and told her,
					“Mia, I’m not on drugs and I’m not hiding. I haven’t gotten high in nine years.”
					We hugged, and she’s crying in my arms. We turn the corner and I open my eyes
					for a second and there’s that motherfucking paparazzi with a lens from here to
					Connecticut. I thought, God, does it never stop? “Mia, here’s what we’re going
					to do. Hold on a minute.” I went into a hardware store we happened to be walking
					past, and asked, “Do you have an umbrella and a can of spray paint—in white,
					preferably?” I took the can, shook it up, and wrote FUCK YOU! on the umbrella,
					opened it up, put it behind us, and we walked down the street! Let ’em get a
					shot of that—all day! I did see it in a few stupid rags, but that was all
					right.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Tim Collins put a spell on me. Svengali, that’s who
					Tim Collins was. He would deliberately say whatever was on his agenda in front
					of groups of people to intimidate them, that way nobody would dare contradict
					him. It’s like if you had been sitting around with a friend of yours the night
					before and the next morning you’re reading the newspaper and you go, “Oh, my
					god, a woman’s decapitated body was found in the woods,” and just then your best
					friend walks in with a shrunken head. Now you’re going to be real fucking
					careful what you say about that best friend of yours, not to mention he ain’t
					your best friend no more.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">As I walked out of Tim Collins’s office for the
					last time, I could see and feel the waves receding like the backwash of a
					speedboat on a calm lake. I turned around and said, “This is the last fucking
					time I’m coming here or I’m ever gonna utter your name.” I fell into the
					wormhole of consuming anger. I could feel the weight of hatred welling behind
					me. It was like standing at the back of the <span class="italic">Queen
						Mary</span> and watching the waves that it throws off.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I didn’t talk to him again until three years ago in
					the elevator at the Mile High stadium in Denver.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“Mr. Tyler,” he said, “so good to see you. There’s
					something I’ve been wanting to say to you for a long time.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“I know what it is. You want to ask my forgiveness
					for that remark.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“How did you know?”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Oh, I knew. When I had last confronted him with all
					the outrageous things he’s done, he simply said, “I’m sorry, you must have
					mistaken me for someone who gives a shit.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I had been devastated. I loved Tim, I trusted him,
					believed in him, and he let me down. Abandonment and betrayal by managers has
					been an ongoing thorn in my side my whole career. But why should I be any
					different from any other performer?</p>
