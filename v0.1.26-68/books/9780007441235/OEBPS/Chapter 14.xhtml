				<p class="x1chap-ttl" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="bold">Holy Smoke, <br />Quest for the
					<br />Grand Pashmina, <br />and the Big Chill <br />of Twenty Summers</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm-first" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="dropcap">I</span> found myself
					making snorting sounds: <span class="italic"
						>fffueh-ffuh-fffeuh-fuh-feu-feu</span>. Snuffling like an armadillo in
					search of fire ants. My nasal passages were completely clogged. No, not from the
					coke! Fuck, no. I stopped in 1980. I stopped smoking. I stopped everything,
					well, for X number of years anyway. To this day, no damage to the nasal
					passages. No, the snuffling was from the way I slept (I used to sleep on my
					back) and the fog juice. My sinuses had mutated, become an alien life form.
					Thirty years of breathing in the damn oil-based fog juice, that’s the stage
					smoke they use to enhance the beams of light. The smoke makes everything look
					bigger and more dramatic. It’s HOLY SMOKE! You see more colors.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">This is how it works: the guy doing the lights hits
					a foot switch that activates the smoke machine behind the drum riser and up
					comes this apocalyptic fog juice. It’s blowing out onstage and I’m inhaling it,
					taking a deep breath to launch into the song:<span class="italic"> “I could lie
						awake</span>”<span class="italic"> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. </span>you know
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. “<span class="italic">just to heh-heheh-heh-hear you
						bruh-breathing!</span>” and I’m going, <span class="italic"
						>ah-heh-ah-hehh-ahh.</span> It’s like being a fucking monkey in a lab
					experiment. A demented researcher is saying, “All right, let’s fill this room
					full of smoke, get the little chimp to sing at the top of his lungs for twenty
					years, and then we’ll run some tests.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">If I get sick I’ve got to cancel. And when
					Aerosmith cancels a show it’s a <span class="italic">million dollars</span>! I
					tell you, the worst time in my life is when I’m taking a shower or sitting in my
					room, it’s one o’clock in the afternoon and we’ve got a gig that night, and I
					go, “<span class="italic">Fuck!</span> I can’t do it.” My voice is gone from
					laryngitis. Either I have a high raspy whine or a deep, bullfroggy honk, but
					either way I can’t sing. I <span class="italic">hate</span> that, I lose it,
					knowing that there’s twenty thousand people on their way to the concert. They’re
					high and happy, thinking they’re going to get laid tonight, and now they’re
					going to find out over the radio that the concert is off and they’re all going
					to go, <span class="italic">Awwwww </span>shit! I <span class="italic"
						>feel</span> for them. Now someone like Axl Rose, on the other hand, will
					handcuff himself to the toilet at the hotel and have people wait four <span
						class="italic">hours</span> for him to show. Why does he do it? That’s just
					how Axl is. He’ll say, “The marbles were thrown and the color red didn’t show
					up, so I can’t get there tonight.” Some astrologi-theosophical omen like that
					and he won’t move.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">We have to take out eight million dollars in
					insurance in case anything goes wrong with Steven the singing monkey. Anything
					could happen to anyone else in the band—unless they break a leg—and the show
					would go on. So once again Steven’s the designated patient. Rather than the band
					spending insurance money if I get sick, I take a shot of a type of cortisone to
					reduce the sinus inflammation—it’s called the Medrol Dose Pack, and it shrinks
					them.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">After years of inhaling fog juice I had a serious
					case of sinusitis. Gunk dripped down my throat like a slow-running faucet. They
					had to operate. Roto-Rootered my sinuses, stuffed them with cotton. I’m lying in
					bed that night after the operation and I wake up ’cause I’m going <span
						class="italic">glllk-glkkk-gulpgm-glllk</span>. Like I’m swallowing in my
					sleep, going, “What is that warm mucuslike gunk?” I reach over and turn the
					light on and—oh, my god!—blood is pouring out of my nose! Dripping like that
					thin stream of water out of the faucet when you’re trying to fill the little
					hole in your water gun. Except it wasn’t a faucet, it was my nose. And it wasn’t
					water .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it was blood.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I freaked out. I said to my wife, “Teresa! Quick!”
					She went in the other room and got a wad of toilet paper. After a minute it was
					soaked. More toilet paper: soaked. With blood. When a human sees that much
					blood, it’s “Call an ambulance!” Ambulance came, took me to the hospital. I’m
					lying there; nobody’s doing anything. “You guys! I’m bleeding to death here!”
					That hospital didn’t have the capabilities to do anything about my bleeding, so
					they stuffed me up with cotton and rushed me down to Mass General. They
					cauterized my nose at one o’clock in the morning, and the bleeding stopped. Two
					hours of hell! Blood all over the place! I had an operation, then everything was
					fine. My nose is still fine, thank you. No schmutz in my lungs, either: <span
						class="italic">hhuh-hhuh-hhuh-hhuh-hhuh</span>. Did you hear anything?</p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="sbdropcap">W</span>hen I
					first blew a tire, so to speak, in my throat, people started saying, “Steven
					Tyler has cancer!” What I actually had was a broken blood vessel in my throat.
					When I had throat surgery the doctor said, “No talking for three weeks.” Now how
					was I supposed to do that? I went back to see him and he said, “You talked!” I
					got deep with it, I said, “What are you talking about, Doc? There isn’t a soul
					on this planet who can shut up for a day, never mind three weeks. Unless I tape
					my mouth up, there’s no way. We’re humans, we’re primates—we talk—and talking is
					my life. People talk in their sleep, they talk to themselves, and personally I
					suffer from being vaccinated with a phonograph needle!” “Steven, another week!”
					he told me and he did that three times. It went on for five weeks—it was a
					fucking nightmare.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">The way they treat a broken blood vessel in the
					throat is just astounding. They put a tiny camera down my throat with a laser
					attached to it. On a computer they draw a line around the spot with the green
					laser beam and then they delete it the way you would a sentence in a
					word-processing program. They tap on the spot and it gets rid of it. Dr. Zeitels
					is in there with a green laser and he’s going, “Gone, gone, gone, gone—” The
					green laser eats the blood under the skin, evaporates it, it’s gone! <span
						class="italic">Star Trek</span>. I watched it back on a monitor, it was
					un-fucking-believable.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">While Dr. Zeitels was working on my throat I told
					him, “I have an idea. We’re playing in Minneapolis. Why don’t you fly to the gig
					with me, bring your gear, that way you can film me before a show, during Joe’s
					solo, and after the show. You’ll get to see what it’s like to be me.” Flew him
					out, he did it. All the way, I’m going, “Doc, I mean, what if we went public
					with this?” “Well, you see, no one’s really done this operation on film before.”
					“So, let’s do it. I’m a lead singer—what more dramatic candidate for this
					operation could you get?” We thought about it for six or seven years and then we
					simply took the film footage of him zapping the blood vessels with a laser, some
					performance stuff, and they began to put the sequence together.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I thought they should get me singing “Dream On.” As
					he was going down my throat, I said, “Oh, shit! If you’re going to film me
					singing ‘Dream On’ while I’m in the chair, I wanna caterwaul the chorus, ‘Dream
					o-on!’ I couldn’t do that if he went down my throat, so he went down my nose
					instead. He put the microcamera in and I really slammed it out, ‘<span
						class="italic">DRE-am o-ONNNN .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. YEee-AH!</span>’ ”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">The footage ended up on <span class="italic"
						>National Geographic</span>’s <span class="italic">The Human Body</span>.
					When they did the show you heard me singing in the chair, the doctor talking,
					and all that stuff, and when I sang that, they could cut to me onstage singing
					it for real.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">While I was at MIT Dr. Zeitels give me a tour of
					the lab. They put me in a red jumpsuit and took me down to the lab to see rats
					growing human ears. What they’re doing there is pure science fiction. They paint
					organic webbing with human skin on it and attach it to the rat, so now it’s
					getting a blood supply, it’s absorbing it—it’s called osmosis.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="sbdropcap">T</span>he whole
						<span class="italic">National Geographic </span>special was interesting
					because it was about the physics of singing, how your throat functions as a
					musical instrument, and how that instrument can bend, melt, twist, and wring
					emotions out of words. Sung words are mutations of written words. You come to a
					phrase in a song, your brain gets altered—words behave very strangely when
					they’re fused with music. What <span class="italic">is</span> music anyway? And
					how does it go from <span class="italic">bom-da-bom-bom</span> into a song? When
					we sing we convey emotion by raising the pitch; the notes change the form of the
					words. Tone determines emotion: praise, stop, pay attention, comfort. A melody
					with a rising tone keeps a child calm; a minor second is jarring. Music
					literally touches you. Sound is touch at a distance; it touches your brain.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Monotone speech is robotic. In tone languages,
					words take on meanings from different pitches. In English we don’t depend on
					tone for meaning, but in Mandarin Chinese, for instance, tone determines the
					meaning. Depending on the tone you use, <span class="italic">ma</span> can mean
					“mother,” “hemp,” “horse,” or “reproach.” The Chinese are very adept at using
					different pitches to indicate meaning, but <span class="italic">perfect</span>
					pitch is very rare: like having a tuning fork in your brain. Everything has a
					voice and a key: a car horn is an F, bells are between D flat and B. One person
					in ten thousand has perfect pitch. Mozart, Bach, and Beethoven all had perfect
					pitch.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I’ve spent my life listening to singers and
					realizing which ones could sing really well and are <span class="italic"
						>still</span> lousy. It has nothing to do with perfect pitch or music
					lessons. Thousands of people sing great, with well-trained voices. The ones that
					have character in their voices are rare. Fucked-up voices with a ton of
					character—that’s my idea of a great voice. My first album, people were going,
					“Steven, I know that’s you singing, but how come it doesn’t sound like you?”
					“Well,” I tell them, “I didn’t like my angelic voice so I did it in my fake
					ghetto voice.” It was then I realized that I needed to fuck it up <span
						class="italic">good</span>. Like the great ones, like Janis: <span
						class="italic">“Whoa Lor-ord woncha buy me-eh a Merrrcedees Benz!”
					</span>That rusty, ornery, bar-at-closing-time voice. She could fuck up a song
					brilliantly. She had a raspy, croaky voice, she was <span class="italic"
						>born</span> with a raspy voice. She had vocal chops that no other singer
					had. She wasn’t the perfect American girl. She was skinny, had long fucking
					thick-ass hair, R. Crumb running out of the pages. You know Angel Food McSpade?
					She was her fucking white counterpart.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">That was Janis! And don’t I know that! I’ve been
					around people who break into a tremulous vibrato: <span class="italic"
						>“Ha-a-a-a-a-a-a-a to-o-o-o-o dre-e-e-e-am the-e-e-e impossible
						dre-e-e-e-e-m.”</span> They’ve <span class="italic">learned</span> that
					shit. They’ve spent thousands of dollars to be able to do that fucking vibrato
					that doesn’t belong in <span class="italic">any </span>fucking song. There’s a
					few who know how to bend it. Robert Plant would do a little bendy thing at the
					end of a song, but it was all from feeling. You go to Broadway and a guy looks
					up at the lights and goes,<span class="italic"
						>“Hmmmm-hmmm-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-NNNN-NNN-NNN-NNNNNNNN!”
					</span>His fucking head goes bobbing back. It’s all a learned, conditioned
					thing; it’s dead as a doornail and stale as a stranded whale.</p>

				<p class="x1bm-space-below" xml:lang="en-us">.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. “a-woo” is the same
					fucking, happy, in-your-face yelp as the chorus to “She Loves You.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">With Aerosmith we do so many different flavors:
					“Game On,” “Shank After Rollin’,” “Seasons of Wither,” “Nine Lives,” “Taste of
					India,” “Ain’t That a Bitch.” We do down-home Delta blues, sleaze boogie,
					anthems, mandolins, steel-drum calypso, wailing sirens, cat-in-heat yelps,
					sentimental ballads, metal, Beatles covers, mooing killer whales, and the
					Shangri Las. You can’t put your finger on what we do, because we do a lot of
					different kinds of music, unlike Metallica, which does only one genre. Have you
					ever heard a slow Metallica song? Is there one that you could dance to at a
					prom? If you asked them, they’d go, “Why would we?”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">You can know all the technical stuff of singing,
					but it doesn’t matter in the end because it’s too over the heads of the audience
					anyway. Once you learn the nuances of music, you’ve got to take it somewhere
					else. There comes a point in most great musicians’ evolution where they no
					longer hear all that underpinning. They only know the words that are thrown over
					the music: <span class="italic">“Every time that I look in the mirror
						.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</span> You take off from that. You don’t know what you’re
					singing or what chord it is.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Animals don’t have brains like ours and are easily
					impressed by big fake-outs. If you hold a blanket up to a bear, it’ll run away.
					They tell you, “Lay down.” Yeah, so it eats your ass?! No, you should go <span
						class="italic">“Arhhhh!,”</span> jump up and down, scream, grab a blanket, a
					big branch. Because an animal doesn’t know the branch isn’t you. Long ago humans
					found out how to extend their egos: If I build a building, it will be an
					extension of <span class="italic">meeeee</span>. People know it’s not you, but
					in some way it <span class="italic">is</span> you. Just like a song—that’s my
					feathers, my proud plumage.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="sbdropcap">I</span>t was
					March 2001 and I was on a quest for the Grand Pashmina—otherwise known as how a
					European tour almost got canceled on account of a six-hundred-pound garden
					ornament. I was up in Sunapee closing up the house. We had a week before going
					on to Europe to begin a tour. I was trying to lift a six-foot black feather lawn
					ornament made out of wrought iron. There was still permafrost in the ground, and
					in trying to move the fucker I pulled both sides of my back out. I couldn’t get
					out of bed without excruciating pain, and the thought was looming in my mind
					that we might have to cancel. The gear’s already on its way over there on a
					steamship. Just to get out of the bed, I’d have to roll on my side and then get
					on my hands and knees and then slowly get up. It is the worst pain on earth—the
					muscles were ruptured. I was under a cloud, just a looming sense of doom
					reawakening my fear of abandonment, the overwhelming feeling of
					I-know-not-what.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I went over to Europe anyway—to do a tour
					promotion. There I am in Munich, freaking fucking out. We get to the hotel and
					there’s the classic promoter’s assistant. They’re always a hoot. Sometimes you
					can play them like an old 45—right before the chorus, you lift off the needle
					because you know what it’s going to be: the thieving, lying voice of the
					promoter. You try to weasel under the thread of their spiel and get into
					whatever is actually going on. But on this trip it wasn’t drugs I was after—I
					was in search of the Grand Pashmina.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">It’s a soft, woven cloth made from the underbelly
					of goats up in the Himalayas. Every night when the stars shine, their fur
					glistens with tiny sparks of light. I bought one for six hundred bucks. It was
					about three feet wide and six feet long, so it could cover me completely, and
					when I pulled up on it, it was like empress chinchilla, softer than the folds of
					a clit. And that took my pain away for a minute, and then it all came back
					horribly, gruesomely, and I finally broke down and said to the promoter’s
					assistant, “Look, I’m in agony, I can’t move, I won’t be able to perform. My
					back is fucking killing me.” And she goes, “Ah! Shtop right zere!” She knows
					about everything in München: legal, illegal, hookers, drugs, record albums,
					Americanisch food. <span class="italic">“Ach, geh scheiss in deinen hut!”</span>
					she said. Literally, “Oh, go shit in your hat!” But basically, fuck off! And I
					said, “Really? Thank you!” But then she took me to this doctor who took care of
					the Munich football team, huge guys who play in the games against England’s
					Chelsea Arsenal and all that. I walk in and there are six blondes from hell,
					German blondes. I went, <span class="italic">Fuck!</span> In the doctor’s office
					I’m lying down on the operating table and I say, “Doc, are you fuckin’ kidding
					with these nurses? How do you work with these gorgeous women?” He goes, “Vell,
					you should see my vife.” “No, but really, what’s goin’ on with them? Is this—?
					Are you—? If you’re not careful I’m going to throw ’em in the back room in a few
					minutes and—” “<span class="italic">Nein,</span> das ist not so good to do,” he
					says. “Dis is vat I got here for you.” And he shows me this concoction that he’s
					going to use to take care of my pulled back. “I deal vith dis all za time. In
					two ho-wars it vill be all ofer.” I said, “What?” “Yah, two ho-wars. I just came
					from America doink the seminar and I showed zem za procedure but zer insurances
					wouldn’t allow it, because ve do injections in your backbone. Zere, zere, zere,
					zere, zere, und zere.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">He’s pointing to the bottom of the spine, on each
					side of the spine, close to the spine itself. You put a needle in a quarter
					inch, because the spinal cord’s <span class="italic">inside</span> the bone.
					There’s a little divot there before it goes to your rib cage, a little bit of
					meat. I’m a little scared and I say, “Can you show me the bottle?” “All right.
					Read zis.” So he goes out and takes care of another patient, and ten minutes
					later I’ve read the whole back and it’s a bizarre concoction, a mixture of
					ground-up liquid rooster comb, shark cartilage, stuff like that and another
					chemical, butopinexopropophine or something. Shark cartilage, rooster, whatever,
					but that fleshy substance—that’s the shit! People swear by shark cartilage here
					in America. Buto-whatever had helped me out for a while, it’s a supplement for
					cartilage, for back pain, knee pain, joint pain, basically a joint pain
					supplement. But now I’m getting the great kahuna of all supplements: the
					cockrilcombsharkcartilegebutoprophine shot. I was scared shitless.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I was very much in the middle of
					should-I-do-it-or-not, and just at that moment I said, “All right, fuck it, do
					it!” He comes in and he gives me a series of twelve shots, on either side of the
					backbone, like L–9, L–10, whatever. A shot of Novocain first, then the
					injections after. Then they brought me into another room that was like a closet
					with a really soft doctor’s table and a bottle hanging from the ceiling. “What’s
					this?” “Oh, don’t worry. It’s amino acids. It helps in healing.” Well, that’s
						<span class="italic">another</span> thing America doesn’t do. A half hour,
					forty-five minutes later, I’m peeing in the bathroom and I noticed my back was
					still a little tight, but it didn’t hurt. Back to the hotel room, watched some
					TV, went to bed, woke up the next morning .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. pain gone. I’m telling
					you, <span class="italic">gone</span>.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="sbdropcap">B</span>ack
					problems seem mild compared to our days of yore, the Aerosmith days of rape and
					pillage through Europe. I remember one time in the late seventies when we so
					destroyed a hotel in Germany that Interpol was waiting for us <span
						class="italic">in the next country. </span>We were in Rotterdam and it was
					“What seems to be the problem, officers?” “<span class="italic">Us,
					</span>international fugitives? What do you mean?” Send lawyers, guns, and
					money. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">No back problems among the savage roadies in those
					days, either. Once when we were in Paris the crew were caught in a traffic jam
					with a bus full of gear. A Citroën had overheated and was smoking in the middle
					of Rue Foche or some such froggy place, so the roadies just lifted the car up
					bodily, put it on the sidewalk, and proceeded to the concert site without
					missing a beat.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Of course in those days they were superhuman,
					fortified by chutzpah, lust, and pharmaceuticals. When a doctor came backstage
					at an Aerosmith concert in those days, they’d say, “Trapper’s here!” And a
					handful of the crew guys would go over to him, get their teeth taken out quick,
					and go, “Oh, man, my tooth fell out yesterday!” Bloody their mouth up a little
					and get OxyContin prescriptions! They’re a fucking bunch of carneys, me
					included. But I’d get the bill and it would be for six hundred bucks.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">What’s right down from Russia? Ukraine? No, Keep
					going. Toward England. Yeah, Finland. <span class="italic">“Hello
						Finland!”</span> We played Helsinki and a bunch of other provinces around
					there. In the Eastern Bloc, I’m looking around and it’s like girls from hell.
					High cheekbones, blond hair, natural blondes—dirty, but not sewn in and not
					stripperlike. Real dirty blond hair with rug to match and you just wanted to get
					down and root for taters. These girls were <span class="italic"
					>gothic.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">There’s a name for a girl that shaves her puss
					because she’s that sexually active and it’s called “Please, Will You Marry Me.”
					It’s the ones with the tattoo down there, the tramp stamp, the Aerosmith logo
					with the wings, that are really hot to trot. Or else that have a tattoo with
					Chinese characters that you don’t know what the fuck it says. <span
						class="italic">Harder,</span> maybe?</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">If someone did a study of rock stars
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Perhaps I should create a chair of Rock Star Sexual Studies at
					some university. Have them write papers on the sexuality of Keith Richards,
					Slash, Mick Jagger, Jimi Hendrix, Janis. The boys that Janis loved—and the
					girls. You’d find that all these rock types have a certain kind of overzealous
					DNA, a bug-eyed hairy monster gene that leers out of their mom’s pussy the

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Everyone wants to see other people naked. I just
					don’t want to see my schlong on YouTube. I have a guy, Juan, do my dressing
					rooms because there’s a camera in the wall somewhere waiting till I take my

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Okay, put on our next CD .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <span

				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="sbdropcap">I</span>t’s
					2001—the new millennium, the New! Improved! Aerosmith! I’m writing “Jaded” with
					Joe. I’m in Joe’s basement, recording, and I ask him, “What’re we doin’ this
					weekend?” Now, Joe, because he doesn’t get thick into lyrics and write melody,
					says, “I’m taking a break. My wife and I are going to the movies.” And I think,
					well, shit, Teresa is going to be fucking furious with me because we’re <span
						class="italic">not</span> going to the movies. I can’t just stop writing
					lyrics in the middle of a song. I can’t sing, <span class="italic">“Hey, jaded,
						you got your mother’s smi-ile, but your”</span>—and then answer the phone
					and just resume what I was writing: <span class="italic">“You’ve got your
						mother’s style, but you’re yesterday’s child to-o me-e, so jaded.
						.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” </span>It’s like climbing a rope out of a well—do you stop
					halfway to answer your cell phone with your foot?</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">When you’re in a train of thought like that, you
					want to keep going. So I went up to Sunapee with my friend the songwriter Marti
					Frederiksen and left Joe and Billie at home to go to the movies. Then I have to
					deal with Teresa yelling at me about if they’re taking the weekend off, why
					don’t you? There’s a little bit of that sideways anger I have toward Joe and his
					wife leaking out. But it’s just what I have to walk through to get that song
					out.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I’m with Marti Frederiksen, we’re out on the lake
					in a canoe, and we’re writing “Jaded.” Monday we come back, we start in with the
					band again, and Joe realizes that I’ve written the song without him. Marti was
					staying at his house and someone in the family read Marti the riot act for being
					a traitor and writing a song when Joe wasn’t there. But, you know, behaviors can
					be forgiven and you got to forgive them, they were high.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Little did I know at the time that Aerosmith’s fate
					depended on that song. According to Donny Ienner, if we hadn’t come up with that
					hit, Sony was getting ready to drop us. Period. He said those words to me: “If
					you hadn’t had that song on <span class="italic">Just Push Play,</span> we would
					have dropped you.” That’s pretty heavy. Shit. But stop me! I can’t write from
					anger. I’m trying to be the lovely <span class="italic">sober</span> Stevie
					that’s glowing, the placenta waters pouring over me.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">With songwriters, when one of you comes up with a
					line, a riff, the other guy doesn’t go, “Oh, shit, he’s getting all the credit
					for this.” Someone picks a little bit of inflection that you said and says
					something that you would have never thought of, and that propels you, the song
					builds, you climb up another rung. You’re a man possessed! You can’t even stop
					to wee-wee! Writing “Jaded”—was it out of anger?</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">When you write a song with somebody you’re evoking
					the spirits of a moment in time, flecks of words, tunes, riffs hovering in the
					air, trip wire, seconds where you sing. When I heard Joe play that riff, I knew
					where to hang my hat.</p>

					died on September 7, 2002. Let a song go out of my heart.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">When bad things happen, people tend to go, “God.
					It’s God. God did everything. There are no coincidences, and everything that
					happens happens for a reason.” Well, I sure don’t think Cyrinda should have died
					from a brain tumor! Was it me? Should I have made my first marriage last, no
					matter what, till death do us part? Should I have made that work? Well, sad to
					say I’m not a good candidate for saving a bad marriage. I could barely keep my
					head above water myself in those days. Or should I have, when I was in rehab,
					forced her to go into rehab with me? “Your toothbrush is packed and you’re
					leaving tomorrow.” That one really haunts me. I told her, “I’ll send the plane,”
					but Cyrinda did not want to go. Who does? I should have gone and gotten her
					myself. That might have worked, but I don’t know. Until people are ready to
					stop, it doesn’t work. And even then it rarely works.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">When I found out she had cancer, I tried to help,
					but it was too little too late. I got my doctors together at Sloan-Kettering to
					check her out, a room at the Grammercy Park Hotel, and bah-be-dah-bah. Such a
					sad end, so unfair for someone who had to put up with me for too much of her
					life.</p>

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I’d known I had hep C for years, because a few
					years before this a doctor had told me, “You know, Steven, you’ve got something
					weird in your blood.” I would do blood tests three times a year and see my viral
					levels. I was asymptomatic, meaning no symptoms, so who gives a shit? People who
					have hep C are usually lethargic and tired. But I never get sick on tour,
					because on the road my subconscious functions on another level from that of
					other humans. It’s as if when I’m about to get sick, the flu, or whatever, it
					goes, “Oh, shit, you’re <span class="italic">going onstage</span>? I’m fucking
					outta here!” I had hep C for four years and it never stopped me.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“Now, Steven,” Dr. Chopra said, “I am very pleased
					your subconscious is so obliging and you are asymptomatic and so on and so
					forth, but veritably, it is time.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">“Time?</span> For what, Dr.

				<p class="x1bm-art-below" xml:lang="en-us">I was staying at my brother-in-law Mark
					Derico’s house because at the time we were in the process of fixing my house,
					rebuilding Taj’s and Chelsea’s rooms, and a lot of other stuff. Teresa would be
					over at the site during the day, and occasionally so would I. The main part of
					the house was cordoned off with tarps. Mark is not only my brother-in-law, but
					when he’s not bulding houses in the New England area, he’s my partner in crime
					in Dirico motorcycles. But later for that. He’s been building houses for the
					last thirty years—some of the finest homes in all of New England, the kind of
					houses that will still be standing two hundred years from now—double insulation,
					commercial standard heating and plumbing, all that stuff. Mark had a troop of
					twelve guys doing major reconstruction, when one of them caught Teresa’s
					eye.</p>
				<p class="art-1" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="generated-style-2"><img

				<p class="captions" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="caption-drop-cap">C</span>helsea,
					me, Taj, and Mia backstage in Boston, 2006. (Ross Halfin for Aerosmith)</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">So the band took the year off. We’re rebuilding the
					house and there’s these roofers and sheetrockers from hell with no shirts and
					pierced nipples and they’re climbing all over the house like red ants fixing it
					up. Chelsea and Teresa would be over there checking on the progress—but little
					did I think that they were looking at these construction workers <span
						class="italic">like that</span>. Teresa had told me that there were some
					hotties over there and Chelsea was buzzing around—she was fourteen, fifteen—but
					stupidly it didn’t occur to me that my wife had her eye on one of the guys, too,
					and that he was making eyes at her—just as I do on the road with hotties in the
					front row.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I said to Sanjiv Chopra, “You know what? Send a
					couple of nurses out and show me how to do it.” So they came out with a month’s
					supply of needles, which come in a box. There’s four in a box, they look like
					darts and they’re filled with interferon and you keep them in the refrigerator.
					The ampoules are loaded, you pinch the fat on your side, which everyone calls
					love handles, but I don’t have, stick in the needle, and go <span class="italic"
						>pkkkkt!</span> into your skin. <span class="italic">Pkkkkt!</span> Monday
						<span class="italic">Pkkkkt!</span> Tuesday. <span class="italic">Pkkkkt!
					</span>Wednesday. My joints ached. I tossed and turned .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
					couldn’t sleep.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">The nurses gave me a month’s supply of interferon
					and a bottle of ribavirin pills—that’s this system called Pegasus for treating
					hep C. I’d been put on interferon ten years ago, and my viral levels actually
					went up—and that’s not good<span class="italic">.</span> But I was reassured
					that that had frequently happened in the past but that the FDA had done new
					tests and released it as effective, mixed with the pills. They claimed this new
					regimen would kick hep C’s ass 70 to 80 percent of the time.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Dr. Chopra told me to do it for nine months—I did
					it for a year. I walked the distance. But the interferon not only kicks hep C’s
					ass, it kicks <span class="italic">your</span> ass. You take three pills in the
					morning and two at night. Your muscles ache, you can’t get out of bed, you hurt
					all over, your hair starts falling out, your fingernails turn yellow, your toes
					turn orange and purple. You feel like you’re dying, and that’s what it is meant
					to do: trick your body into thinking it’s dying. Your immune system goes, “Oh,
					shit! I’ve gotta get it together and knock this thing out of my system or we’re
					both gonna croak!” If there’s anything threatening your body, your immune system
					revs up, kicks ass, and kills it. The hep C virus lives primarily in the liver.
					But you can’t inject the liver; whatever you put in there doesn’t stay, it gets
					pissed out. So how else to deal with problems connected with the liver than by
					putting your whole immune system in jeopardy?</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Several times in the night, I would have to move
					over to the other side of the king-size bed because there would be a huge wet
					spot—and not from the reasons I would have loved. I’d go through four T-shirts a
					night, I’d wake up all clammy and wring them out. Your body’s sweating, thinking
					it’s dying. I did the whole process for a year, but after the third month, I
					said, “Fuck this, I can’t stand the pain,” so I went to the doctor. I told him,
					“I’m not taking anything. I’m a drug addict and alcoholic and proud of it, and
					I’m not gonna!” And Dr. Chopra in his all-knowing-all-seeing voice, says, “Well,
					I don’t want you to suffer.” At which time the addict in me responded, “All
					right, Doc, give me whatever ya got.” I’m on half a Vicodin in the morning and
					half at night. This could be a litmus test for addicts: if you give five people
					Vicodin, four will fall asleep and one will stay up and clean his room. That
					would be the addict—and that would be me. So now I need a sleeping pill to get
					me outta my room. Oooh, my addict loves that!</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">So it’s the third month into the hep C treatment,
					and I’m back on the drugs. My wife decides to leave me (let another song go out
					of my heart!), I’ve got both the kids in the house. I’ve been diagnosed with a
					brain tumor, and on top of it all, the doctors say I’m in a clinical depression.
					Ya think? I’m a fuckin’ mess (who wouldn’t be). Oh, God! What next?</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">What the hell! Was there a snaggle-toothed witch

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Is that my phone beeping or is it my brain? Does
					the noise in my head bother you?</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">For five months I was a weeping, crying mess living
					in the other side of my house, sleeping in a room with my son, Taj, who at the
					time was eight. He’s worried about what’s going to happen to his mom.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“Mom’s gonna be fine,” I’m telling him. “Don’t
					worry, everything’s gonna be all right,” as I hold back the tears. I never cried
					in front of the kids when it came to me and their mother. I loved her then as I
					love her today. And I would never let them think that I didn’t.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">It was the first time the band took a year off in
					thirty years. They went to Florida, bought cars and fucked and ate ice cream,
					and I went through hep C hell and lost my wife. Alleged friends of mine, people
					reading some crackpot book, would say to me, “Steven, dude, it’s your karma, you
					had it coming.” I-don’t-think-so. After the hep C treatment, I was doing half a
					Vicodin twice a day and all that. I had twelve years’ sobriety when all that
					shit hit the fan.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">And so the hep C treatment went for a year of that,
					and then I doubled up on the pills: I took three in the morning <span
						class="italic">and</span> three at night. I locked myself in my uncle
					Ernie’s room in the back part of my house and lived there. I was off and running
					with the drugs. Most people stop the hep C treatment. They start doing it and
					they go, “Fuck this, I can’t go to work!” Luckily I didn’t have to go to work.
					Killing the hep C was my job. I persisted. And now I’m durn near down with the
					flu.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. My toe got sick and my liver too. Oh, man, I’m
					beginning to sound like a Luke the Drifter song:</p>
				<p class="x1song-first" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">The hogs took the

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">And ten months, twelve months later, nondetectable

					Wife’s still gone, but we go back on tour. I was lucky for the diversion but
					still brokenhearted.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="sbdropcap">T</span>eresa
					left me for this young guy with pierced nipples who was building our house. Why
					she did it I don’t know. Everyone’s got their reasons—even Hitler had his
					reasons! “You were gone for ten years,” she told me. It killed me. I may have
					cheated on her, but I was home every night I wasn’t touring. You have a
					marriage, you got kids, you bring millions of dollars home. It doesn’t make any
					difference. You had an affair! You cheating, adulterous, sonofabitch! And to her
					I was that guy.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">If a woman marries a rock star, doesn’t she know
					that women are constantly throwing themselves at him, and being a man, what is
					he meant to do? How about if I was married to Pam Anderson? Would I be surprised
					if last time she visited Kid Rock they slept together that night? Fuck no! I
					could be completely wrong here .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but she’s a sex symbol and I’d
					have to understand that. Sex symbols attract sex and they get off on the
					interplay. It’s the drama of it, and that’s how they derive their sense of
					power. True or false? I’ve heard this over and over and I tend to agree. But in
					the end I hurt her and I so regret what I did.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">We could’ve worked it out. “You’d rather leave me
					than work through it!” I said. Of course, I made the mistake of going to her and
					telling her I’d had an affair. My friends would say, “What’d you tell her for?
					You goddamn fool!” And they’d be fuckin’ right. When I was younger, for guys it
					was “Lie till you die.” There <span class="italic">is</span> no telling a woman.
						<span class="italic">Especially</span> if she says to you, “Just tell me the
					truth, I won’t be mad.” </p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="sbdropcap">I</span>n August
					2008, my daughter Mia had a book out called <span class="italic">Creating
						Myself: How I Learned That Beauty Comes in All Shapes, Sizes, and Packages,
						Including Me. </span>She called me up: “Daddy, I’m going to be on <span
						class="italic">Good Morning America </span>with Matt Lauer and talk about
					the book. I just wanted you to know.” When I saw her talk about her problems I
					was mortified. She was telling the world that she’s a cutter—still cuts herself
					when she’s stressed. It really hit me hard, because I wasn’t there for her when
					she was growing up. Oprah and everybody watching who gets the big picture is
					going to go: “What a bitch of a father! She must have been crying in the empty
					house and in a desperate state and turned to cutting herself.” And that’s what I
					knew when I read her book.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Like father like daughter. Mia had drug problems as
					a teenager—drinking, diet pills—but I didn’t know about her cutting herself. At
					one point I tricked her into going to rehab, saying I was sending her to a spa
					in California. My heart broke thinking that I had anything to do with her drug
					addiction. In the end I told her about this old AA slogan that I’d heard in the
					halls, where a lot of people vent their woes: “A lot of your problems have my
					name on them, but most of the solutions will have your name on them.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Not long after that I was walking along the beach,
					I dropped to my knees, I began crying because I realized that I’d gotten sober,
					but I hadn’t done it for my kids, or even my own health. I hadn’t thought about
					them when I was using, so why would I have gotten sober for them, either. Drugs
					robbed me of my spirituality and compassion, only later to find I’d lost Liv and
					Mia as well—I cried when they forgave me for my past behaviors but I’ll be
					working on it for the rest of my life.</p>
