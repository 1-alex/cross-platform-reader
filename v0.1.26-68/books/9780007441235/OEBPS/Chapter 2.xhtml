				<p class="x1bm-first" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="dropcap">T</span>wo months
					before my eighth birthday—Elvis! “Heartbreak Hotel,” “Hound Dog.” It was like
					getting bitten by a radioactive spider. Elvis .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the
					Extraterrestrial. But it wasn’t Elvis who first turned me on to rock ’n’ roll. I
					was too young to quite get it. But four years later, Chubby Checker and Dimah
					the Incredible Diving Horse came roaring into my life.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">By the time I was twelve, Chubby Checker’s “Twist”
					was <span class="italic">huge. </span>It was the only single to top <span
						class="italic">Billboard</span>’s Hot 100 <span class="italic">twice</span>.
					I went with my family in the summer of 1960 and saw him at the Steel Pier in New
					Jersey. It was such a big fucking hit even your parents wanted to see him. He
					was playing live that night <span class="italic">and</span> I got to see a woman
					on a horse jump off a thirty-foot diving platform into a tank of water. The
					announcer said: “Ladies and Gentlemen, Dimah the Wonder Horse is going to dive
					into this small tank of water. Her rider, Miss Olive Gelnaw, will guide Dimah
					during her thirty-foot drop into the tank. Now, we need you to be very quiet. It
					takes all of her concentration to get it right, or they will miss the tank and
					fall to their death.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Dimah and her rider made a perfect dive and landed
					in the tank. Most of the water flew up in a huge wave over the side of the tank
					and the crowd went wild. And those two images—Chubby Checker doing the Twist and
					the sexy girl in a bathing suit on a huge horse in a death-defying leap—fused in
					my mind. And that was my introduction to the world of rock ’n’ roll.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I heard sex in “Twist.” I didn’t know what sex was,
					I hadn’t gotten laid yet, I didn’t know how to <span class="italic">do</span>
					sex, I didn’t know what blow jobs were—“and I’m supposed to put my thing in your
						<span class="italic">what</span>?” But I heard sex in the music. <span
						class="italic">And that’s what I loved</span>. I loved that someone could
					allude to the most primal of instincts—what everybody wanted to do on a date—and
					put it in a song on the radio, and if the song came on and you were <span
						class="italic">with</span>
					<span class="italic">your date,</span> you ended up Doing It! Wow! And then
					there was the Fuck-All of it! All the things you couldn’t say or do, you could
					do onstage or in your music. What about that Ian Whitcomb song? Where he sings
					like a girl and he’s begging a girl. By singing it in that crazy falsetto voice
					he was able to convey unspeakable emotions that made girls blush and turned
					heads everywhere. And he nailed it, it was a huge hit. And they all had the same
					things in common: Little Richard’s high falsetto screams that incited the
					Beatles’ high harmonies, and then there was the end of Ian Whitcomb’s “Turn on
					Song,” which spoke to those who heard it like a breathy wet spot that climbed
					right out of the speakers and grabbed you by the neck and made your ears cry
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and there was nothing you could do about it except dance or be
					the lead singer of a band and do it all yourself.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">And then, later on, I went and saw Janis Joplin.
					Now that really was my world—pure emotion. Onstage she played the role of that
					gin-soaked barroom queen. With her gravelly Delta voice and street smarts she
					could have only gotten by going through all these experiences herself, she
					transcended all those who came before her. The way she sang a song it seemed
					like she’d been down that road one too many times and it wasn’t going to happen
					again—not this time round. She had a brand-new kind of kick-ass confidence laced
					with a “superhippie,” smart-ass, kinky-kinda-sassafrassy strut to her vocals,
					the likes of which you’d never heard before. After seeing Janis, it almost
					seemed like you’d come from a raise-the-tent, raise-your-spirit Pentecostal Holy
					Roller revelation-type thing. It was <span class="italic">that</span> kind of
					mind-altering sound. And it was like, oh, my god! There was such a raunchy
					matter-of-factness, a drug-induced-sexy-animal rush to the way she belted out
					“Piece of my Heart.” I mean, that was the <span class="italic">shit</span>. It
					was almost as if she gave her heart away a thousand times and never did quite
					get it back.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Janis up there—Janis, what a grand dame, like
					someone’s mom, but a cross between a stately old woman and a loud, brassy New
					Orleans bordello whore. That was the end of the sixties. That’s what Janis was
					to me—a revolutionary spirit, someone who changed the emotional weather.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, Eddie Cochran, Little
					Richard. “Roll Over Beethoven,” “Who Do You Love,” <span class="italic"
						>Awopbopaloolaawop-ba-ba-bam-mboom!</span> Pure adrenaline rush. I’d been
					zapped by an alien tractor beam and it was pulling me toward the mother
					ship.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">The Beach Boys! “In My Room.” Oh, my god! All I can
					tell you is that my girlfriend got turned on just now hearing me say those words
					with such ecstatic glee. That song was the first time I got up from behind the
					drums and grabbed the microphone away from my bass player and said, “You know
					what, I’m singing that fucking song, pal!” And then—<span class="italic"
						>abracadabra!—</span>I became a singer! I bought a gooseneck and put the
					microphone on it. “<span class="italic">Ladies and genitals, give it up for
						Steven Tallarico on vocals! </span>” But I’m getting ahead of my story
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">By the time I was fifteen I knew what I wanted to
					do—aside from getting high and trying to get into girls’ pants under the
					aqueduct. Drums! A friend’s big brother had a drum set in the basement. We snuck
					down there and when I saw that set of drums I was <span class="italic"
						>in-fat-chu-ated</span>! I couldn’t believe that something you banged on
					made <span class="italic">that much noise</span>—and it wasn’t pots and pans. I
					sat down behind the snare drums, and that was the beginning of the end. I bought
					instruction records by Sandy Nelson, who introduced the drum solo into pop
					singles in the late fifties. His big hit was “Let There Be Drums” in ’61. He
					would play these cool beats at the end, just on a snare. It sounded like ten
					snares doing a marching beat. That’s funk <span class="italic">and</span> soul
					right there. Fucking everything! There was my card: I just landed on that
					fucking place in the great game of life. My pass-go card, my
					get-out-of-jail-free card. That was the magic. That’s the funk the blacks knew.
					That’s the soul that Elvis knew, right there, and now I had the key to it all,
					especially after attending the Westchester Workshop Drums Unlimited.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I went to lessons at the WWDU. A guy gave me a
					rubber thing with heavy sticks and I learned my rudiments .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
					paradiddles and stuff. I listened to those Sandy Nelson records like the Beatles
					LPs when they came out. My head practically INSIDE the speaker, hanging on every
					movement, every nuance of soundage, REVELING in it. But at the end of one album,
					Sandy had this thing—like a cross between an 007 guitar and surf rock—a
					Ventures/Dick Dale <span class="italic">rata-tat-tat,</span> basically with
					accents. <span class="italic">It’s all accents.</span> He took the drum beat but
					gave it a twist, and that one thing was the turning point .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <span
						class="italic">the way he reversed the beat through the accents</span>. I
					fucking lost it! “I gotta know that!” screamed the mouth within. So, like I said
					before, I got under the hood and learned it.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">The first time I got up onstage to play was at the
					Barn. It must’ve been the summer of 1963. A group called the Maniacs were
					playing, and when they’d finished their set, they let me up onstage. “I’d like
					to introduce .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Steven Tallarico.” I played the classic drum solo
					on “Wipeout.” It was just a speeded-up version of a riff from a high school
					marching band beat but it sounded stratospheric—a pure sex, drugs, and rock ’n’
					roll rush. All right, now I <span class="italic">knew</span>. I was making a
					huge racket with this demolition-derby–driven surfer blast. Everybody loved it
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <span class="italic">I </span>loved it. John Conrad, the guy who
					ran the Barn, was beaming—I was in the zone.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">When I think about it now, forty-nine years later,
					I still have the same rush of feeling, that same energy and joy of the
					endorphins flooding my brain. It’s close to an addiction. I close my eyes and I
					just want to do it. To play that set and sing those songs—those songs were my
					way out.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="sbdropcap">I</span> got
					into street fights in the Bronx all the time—an hour and a half they went on,
					I’d come home bloody as hell. I was made fun of quite a lot at high school.
					Jewish kids were constantly picked on—they got to see a side of life the other
					half doesn’t see. Prejudice. I got spit on in school and called “Nigger Lips.”
					The kids would snap my earlobes with their fingers, which was especially painful
					on freezing cold days. Being hassled at the bus stop, however, turned out to be
					my salvation. Initially I might have been offended, but as soon as I learned how
					to sing, I was right proud of that moniker, because I then realized that those
					were my roots, my black roots were in black music, and it was nothing to be
					ashamed of.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">My family history—if you go back two hundred years
					ago—the Tallaricos were from the boot of Italy, Calabria. And before that?
					Albanians, Egyptians, Ethiopians. But let’s face it, in the end—in the
					beginning, actually—we’re all Africans. You can’t grow humans in cold weather.
					And before we were humans we were apes, and if <span class="italic">we</span>
					can’t take the cold weather, how could a monkey, who doesn’t even know how to
					buy a coat? So if you go back, you’re black. It’s so stupid to go around saying,
					“I’m Italian” (the way I do all the time).</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">My way of avoiding being beaten up at school was to
					play the drums in a band. My first group was the Strangers: Don Solomon, Peter
					Stahl, and Alan Stohmayer. Peter played guitar, Alan bass, Don was the lead
					singer, and I played drums. We would set up in the cafeteria and do a mixer
					after school. I played “Wipeout” and sang “In My Room.” In high school the key
					to not being made fun of is to be entertaining, the same way that some fat
					people become funny, tell jokes, make fun of people, and then they get left
					alone. I was skinny and big-lipped and pinheaded. I grew my hair and played the
					drums in a band, and that was my key to acceptance. I knew about music from my
					dad, and so rock ’n’ roll was a case of
					please-don’t-throw-me-in-the-Briar-Patch!</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I was giddily starstruck. At the Brooklyn Fox I ran
					up onstage and touched Mary Weiss, the lead singer of the bad-girl group the
					Shangri-Las. With her long blond hair, black leather pants, and melancholy eyes,
					Mary Weiss was a teen goddess. She alone was reason enough for making rock ’n’
					roll your own personal religion, especially while she was singing “Leader of the
					Pack.” She was a gorgeous tough girl who later got questioned by the FBI for
					carrying a gun across state lines. I was completely smitten with her. The next
					time I saw her it was a little more intimate—but not because Mary Weiss wanted
					it that way. In 1966 I went to Cleveland with one of my later bands, Chain
					Reaction, to do this teen dance show, <span class="italic">Upbeat</span>. I
					wanted to sing lead, so I got David Conrad (nephew of John Conrad, who ran the
					Barn) to play drums. There were no dressing rooms, so I went into the bathroom
					to change. I heard someone in the next stall. Thinking it was David, as a joke I
					hoisted myself up to the top of the stall. But when I peered over, there was
					Mary Weiss, with her black leather pants around her ankles and her patch
					showing. I got such the boner from that—I fantasized about that for weeks! It
					got me through a lot of cold winter nights up in Sunapee.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">At our house in Yonkers, no one locked their doors,
					so with the advent of sex and drugs I had to figure something out to stop anyone
					from catching me smoking pot or rubbing one out or whatever else I was doing up
					there. A serious problem for a teenager. You had to put a chair in front of the
					door, but what a drag! From working with traps I knew how to rig things, and I
					came up with an ingenious way of locking a door. I drilled through the
					tongue—the metal latch that goes into the strike plate of the door—and put a
					coat hanger through it, leaving four inches sticking out like a pin on a hand
					grenade. If you turned the handle the door wouldn’t open.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Then I devised a more fiendish plan. Through the
					mail I bought an induction coil, which is nothing more than a transformer for an
					electric train. On your train set you can turn the transformer up to ten,
					twenty, thirty, forty, so your Lionel train is just <span class="italic"
						>whippin’</span> around the track until it’s going so fast it falls off the
					tracks. I took the induction coil and attached it to the railing on the way up
					to my room so that if anyone touched that railing, they’d be zapped right off
					their feet. I’d be upstairs doing a girl, parents were gone for the weekend,
					those few, chosen moments when I needed serious warning. And YES, people did get
					zapped. But only my best friends! I’d go, “Touch that!” and they’d go “<span
						class="italic">Yeeoooow!</span>” Suddenly best friends were so well behaved.
					I don’t know what happened.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Once I ran a wire all the way down to the basement
					and up under the couch and the pillows. I undid the wires, stripped about four
					inches off the insulation, spread them out—the positive and negative wires—and
					put them under the cushions so that whoever sat on the couch would get zapped.
					My best friend was down there eating peanuts. “Here, have this beer,” I said.
					“I’ll be right back!” I’m upstairs in my room, turning the train transformer on,
					and I get the door open and I switch it on. I’d hear the transformer buzz as it
					connected. I’m waiting there, listening to hear what happens .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
						<span class="italic">“Yow!”</span> Just a little evil teenage fun.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">When “The House of the Rising Sun” came on the
					radio, I thought it was the greatest record I’d ever heard. I saw the Animals
					perform it at the Academy of Music and was so overcome with raw emotion I jumped
					out of my seat, ran up the aisle, and shook the bass player Chas Chandler’s
					hand. Then came the Stones. Rock is my religion, and these guys were my
					gods!</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">You don’t need to go to the fucking Temple of Doom
					to find my banter on the Stones or the Yardbirds—what I thought about back then
					in my sixteen-year-old make-believe mind. It would have been the desire to write
					a song or be in an English band when the first Brit Invasion came over and—more
					than <span class="italic">anything</span>—fame! Immortality! I wanted to inject
					myself into the grooves of the record. I wanted dreamy nubile girls to listen to
					my voice and cry. A thousand years after my death I fantasized that there’d be
					people in the outer galaxies listening to “Dream On” and saying in hushed tones,
					“It’s <span class="italic">him</span>, the strange Immortal One!”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">And then, briefly, I <span class="italic"
						>was</span> touched by the caressing hand of fate when, sometime in 1964, I
					became Mick Jagger’s brother, Chris. Mick Jagger was the baddest guy on the
					block, and of course I empathetically picked up on all his shit. Mick and Keith
					and all that—it hit me like a locomotive. “It’s All Over Now” was like a fucking
					blues freight train coming straight at me.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">In the summer of ’64, I went to a lake in upstate
					New York, Bash Bish Falls or something like that, up near Utica, with a bunch of
					kids from Yonkers. Long hair, sixteen, no band, but somebody said, “Wow, you
					look like Mick Jagger!” And that was it .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <span class="italic">off
						and running</span>! “You know what, I’m Chris, Mick Jagger’s brovver. I am
						<span class="italic">him</span>!” And I went with it like mad. Shot off from
					there to this Limey planet and immediately lapsed into a Cockney accent. I was
					talking like “<span class="italic">Bloody bleedin’ ’poncey wanker, spot of
						Marmite, darlin’? Care for a leaper, mate? Ghastly weather we’re ’avin,
						innit?” </span>It’s called, you know, lost days of youth. When you’re a kid
					you can jump into other people’s personalities like a transmute. I can still
					relate to that.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">In those days of the British Invasion you had to be
					a Brit to make it. First of all, you had to have a bloody English accent. That
					was number one. And that I could do. I still have those Strangers clippings at
					home: “Steven Tyler, his lower lip hanging like Jagger’s, brought the front row
					to its feet.” They wrote that in the paper. Bought my Mick impersonation lock,
					stock, and barrel. I couldn’t believe it. But of course, I—more than anyone else
					on the planet—believed it. I <span class="italic">was</span> him. I was barely
					sixteen but in my mind already one of “England’s Greatest Hit Makers.” Even if
					the Strangers sounded more like a bad imitation of Freddie and the Dreamers than
					the Stones. <span class="italic">Yonkers </span>Greatest Hit Makers maybe.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">In the early seventies I was embarrassed to say I
					was into Mick, because the press was already harping on the Mick Jagger and
					Steven Tyler thing and I wanted to get as far away as possible from those
					comparisons. I was hoping they would find something in my music that would have
					some merit other than making Aerosmith into some sort of tribute band with me as
					a mock Mick Jagger.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">But yes, he was my fucking hero. There was actually
					a six- or seven-year period where I was afraid to tell the press that. I was,
					like, “No he isn’t!” And then, of course, I came out of the closet and went,
					“Fuckin’ A, he is!” To this day, to this minute, to this second, Mick Jagger is
					still my hero. I remember being at a club at One Central Square in the West
					Village in early ’66, turning around and seeing Mick Jagger and Brian Jones
					sitting behind me. Not a word came out of my mouth.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I didn’t become Steven Tyler all at once. I made
					him up, bit by bit. He kind of grew out of playing all the clubs in New York and
					doing acid and hanging out in Greenwich Village and tripping and going to <span
						class="italic">be-ins</span> in Central Park. All that stuff is where I come
					from. But more than anything I was shaped by the kind of music that I listened
					to in ’64, ’65, ’66. The Yardbirds, the Stones, the Animals, the Pretty Things
					and their wild drummer Viv Prince—he was Keith Moon before Keith Moon became the
					maniacal drummer of the Who. Moon used to go down to the Marquee Club to watch
					him and pick up a few mad moves. And of course the Beatles, whom I saw at Shea
					Stadium. They were the musical G-spot.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I’d get all the Brit imports from a record store
					down in the IRT subway station at Forty-sixth Street. Those Yardbirds 45s: “For
					Your Love,” “Shapes of Things,” “Over Under Sideways Down.” That’s what I cut my
					teeth on—not that I was in any shape in 1964 to take all that stuff and run with
					it. I’d take speed and listen to the Yardbirds, the Pretty Things, the Stones.
					We were what—sixteen? You couldn’t drink till you were eighteen, so all we could
					do was grass and pills .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. red crosses, white crosses, Christmas
					trees, Dexedrine, Benzedrine. I’d go up to Sunapee in the winter and sit in the
					barn—four feet of snow outside—light a fire, and snort speed until I was
					vibrating at the same frequency as the fucking records.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-art-below" xml:lang="en-us">The Strangers slowly began to get gigs.
					We played a lot of weird places at the beginning, like Banana Fish Park on Long
					Island. We even had a slogan: “T<span class="sc">HE</span> S<span class="sc"
						>TRANGERS</span>—E<span class="sc">NGLISH</span> S<span class="sc"
						>OUNDS</span>, A<span class="sc">MERICAN</span> R<span class="sc"
						>&amp;</span>B.” At Easter my mom drove the Strangers up to Sunapee to
					perform. We played stuff like “She’s a Woman” and the Dave Clark Five’s “Bits
					and Pieces.”</p>

				<p class="captions" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="caption-drop-cap">M</span>y life
					four years before Aerosmith&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <br />with The Strangers.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">My motto has always been: “<span class="sc">FAKE IT
						TILL YOU MAKE IT</span>.” If you wanna be a rock ’n’ roll star (like Keith
					Richards says) you gotta get your moves off in the mirror first. The <span
						class="italic">look</span>. Pick up a copy of <span class="italic"
						>Rave</span> magazine, see what the cool cats are wearing in Swinging London
					this month. <span class="italic">Rave</span> was the midsixties Brit mag of
					immaculate Mod haberdashery. Check out Mick’s houndstooth pants. And <span
						class="italic">green</span> shoes. Where’d Keith Relf get those wraparound
					shades, man? You gotta stay on top of this stuff, you know, if you wanna be a
					rock star. Gotta be properly attired in the latest Mod gear when the moment
					arises and the fickle finger of <span class="italic">Billboard</span>’s Top Ten
					touches you.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I scoured the pseudo–Carnaby Street boutiques of
					Greenwich Village for the genuine article. Collarless shirts, leather vests, and
					checkered pants at Paul Sargent’s on Eighth Street. Beatle boots with Cuban
					heels from Bloom’s Shoe Gallery in the West Village or Florsheim Shoes on
					Forty-second Street. They had the fuckin’ greatest boots, high heels, tight
					around the ankles—those were the ones I wore onstage. Then there were the Mod
					shoes, brightly colored Capezio ballet shoes, flowered shirts, and satin
					scarves—well, okay, the scarves came later (inspired by Janis Joplin). Those I
					got along with my incense from Sindori (is that what the place was called?), an
					import store across the street from the Fillmore East.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">In the early days, I would put incense all over the
					amps and in front of the stage to mark my territory. I thought by burning exotic
					scents like myrrh they’d remember me by my smell, like God in their church. I
					wanted something other than our bad tuning and my ugly fucking Mick Jagger face
					to remember us by. It’s like if I were a dog, I would go out to the tip of the
					stage, lift my leg, pee, and say, “I’d like to leave a little something for you
					to remember me by.” Dogs piss on trees to mark their territory, so I marked mine
					with incense and banners—like old Scottish tartans that I found, the ones that
					held special family colors and crests.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">It’s so funny, the obsessive Limey mimicking that
					went on. Back in 1966, down on Delancey Street, where the blacks got their
					stuff, you could get a beautiful leather jacket for twenty-six bucks
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but who had twenty-six bucks back then? I’d hang around Bloom’s
					Shoe Gallery just waiting to see who would go in. I bought all my shit there,
					you know, because <span class="italic">they</span> did. The Stones, the Byrds,
					Dylan. Mike Clark, the drummer for the Byrds, turned me on to this place in
					Estes Park, Colorado, where he got his moccasins, the ones he wore on an album
					cover. I asked him, “How could I get a pair of those?” He gave me the address
					and I got me a pair, which I later on brought into the studio where we were
					recording our first album. I got the rubber-stamp holder with all the different
					rubber stamps they used to mark the two-inch master reels. The rubber stamps
					would say “<span class="sc">DOLBY OUTTAKES</span>,” “<span class="sc">REMIX
						VERSION</span>. <span class="sc">SLAVE</span>, <span class="sc"
						>MASTER</span>”<span class="sc">—</span>all things that could be done to
					tapes. I rubber-stamped my moccasins, which I chose to call my recording boots,
					all over and I wore them till the soles fell off.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Bloom’s Shoe Gallery was where I ran into Bob
					Dylan. Okay, he was coming out of there and I was walking in. I’d love to have a
					great story where I told him I was in a band (I wasn’t). I wish I could’ve told
					him I loved his voice (I did). I used to go down and walk around Greenwich
					Village, all the time hoping to bump into the Stones, which of course never
					happened. I never got a chance to speak to Dylan or Keith or Mick to ask them
					how the fuck they wrote their songs. I assumed they had to get their lyrics from
					their life experiences. I knew that drugs had something to do with it. I’d heard
					that Pete Townshend’s stutter in “My Generation” came from leapers, some
					weirdass British speed. Tuinals, acid, and grass .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I knew about
					those. And there was this drug called “coke.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I had been around the block and I’d done as much
					crank as anyone, but somewhere along the line I decided to do something else
					instead of using the speed to go and party in the Village. Fuck that, I think
					I’ll stay at home tonight and channel John Lennon. I’ll write a song based on my
					muddled understandings <span class="italic">and</span> my profound
					misunderstandings that’ll change the world. But it took a while to get to that
					place.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-art-below" xml:lang="en-us">New York City was filled with very odd
					folk—which I loved. I’d take my mother’s car down to the city, park it on the
					street, get a parking ticket, throw it away, and drive home. I can’t imagine how
					many tickets I got. I know I never paid any of them. A rock ’n’ roll Dillinger
					in the making. Or I’d leave the car in the Bronx at the first train stop, which
					was past White Plains and Yonkers Raceway, get on the train, and get off at
					Fifty-ninth Street, Columbus Circle. The Fifty-ninth Street subway stop wasn’t
					that far from where Moondog would stand with his spear and Viking helmet. He
					lived on the street, wore only homemade clothes, and thought of himself as the
					incarnation of the Norse God Thor. He was so noble and mysterious, like a
					character from mythology come to life on Sixth Avenue.</p>

					for Greenwich Village because that’s where the beatniks lived and we wanted to
					be beatniks. It was the summer of ’64. I was a white boy from Yonkers, trying to
					get high, trying to get hip. We’d sit in Washington Square Park drinking
					Southern Comfort or Seagrams 7 (or whatever else we could mooch off somebody)
					until we were completely shitfaced on booze, pills, and pot. Then we’d go check
					out the clubs! The Kettle of Fish, the Tin Angel, the Bitter End, the Night Owl,

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">One night we were wandering around the Village and
					saw a group advertising itself as the Strangers outside a club—they seemed to be
					a pretty established band and sounded better than us, so we decided to change
					our name to the mildly pretentious Strangeurs.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I’d go down there Friday night, come home Sunday. I
						<span class="italic">loved </span>it; I wanted that life so bad. I’d sit on
					a car in the West Village outside the Tin Angel with Zal Yanovsky from the
					Lovin’ Spoonful and talk. He wore culottes, a Bleecker Street Keith Richards.
					And Josie the She Demon—a transvestite who paraded around Greenwich Village with
					no particular mission save her own sense of eccentric expression. It was just
					such a trip. Then uptown there was Ondine’s, and Steve Paul’s club, the Scene.
					Teddy Slatus was the doorman at the Scene, a runty little guy. You’d go down the
					stairs into a cellar. It was like the beatnik grottoes from old movies. Low
					ceiling, small, cramped, but magical. Everybody looked like Andy Warhol. Steve
					Paul in his turtleneck, tall, talking in a beat lingo so fast and clipped you
					could barely grasp what he was saying, but you knew it was hip and one day you’d
					be able to understand it. Late at night, Jimi Hendrix, Paul McCartney, or Brian
					Jones would just show up and play—they’d be on a tiny stage about four feet away
					from you. I performed there early in ’68, with my second band, William Proud,
					with Tiny Tim singing and playing “Tiptoe Through the Tulips” on his ukulele, a
					tall skinny Lebanese freak with long greasy hair, a high voice, and bad teeth.
					But that was the great thing about the Scene: he wasn’t treated like a sideshow
					character—it was more like .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. this is the artist in residence.
						<span class="italic">He</span> belongs—you’ve gotta get in tune with <span
						class="italic">him</span> if you want to fit in.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I would go see bands like the Doors at the Scene,
					and I couldn’t believe the way the lead singer was acting. I thought, “Wow! What
					the fuck?” But maybe that’s the reason people loved the Doors—because they
					really thought Jim Morrison was possessed. That club was seriously in your face.
					I can’t tell you how close you were to the performers. You sat at a little
					table, and right there was the Lizard King three feet away from you.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I was Steve Tally, copying everything I saw,
					reading the poetry that Dylan was reading—Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, Gregory
					Corso. There were readings at the Kettle of Fish, where Dylan would show up and
					recite his incredible shit. I’d sit there slack-jawed and hypnotized.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">In ’65 the Stones had two monster hits:
					“Satisfaction” and “Get Off of My Cloud.” We heard that they were staying at the
					Lincoln Square Motor Inn, so we got our friend Henry Smith to drive us down
					there in his mother’s car with the excuse that we needed to go rehearse. I
					already had my mock Mick look down, and we got our bass player, Alan Stohmayer,
					who had blond bangs like Brian Jones, to come with us. When we got there, the
					streets around the hotel were mobbed with kids. Very cute, very hot girls—Stones
					fans. Well, how could I resist trying out my Mick impersonation on this
					crowd?</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I leaned out the window and in a very loud, crude
					Cockney accent said, “I say, I see some smashing crumpets out there, mates. Wot
					you doin’, later then, darlin’?” They went wild. “Mick! Mick!” “Brian, I love
					you!” Tears streaming down their faces. Lovely—except that they wrecked Henry’s
					mother’s car, tore off the radio antenna and the windshield wipers. It turned
					into a big riot and got on TV on the evening news. When we got back, Henry’s
					mother was standing there with her arms crossed. “Have a good rehearsal,
					boys?”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Because we were too young to drink at clubs in the
					city, I took Tuinals and Seconals. I’d crush all that shit up and snort it. I
					was always fucked-up when we got into Manhattan. That same night we were at the
					Scene, we saw Monty Rock III! We all knew about him from watching the <span
						class="italic">Johnny Carson Show </span>on TV. On would come this very
					grand queen with a let’s-tell-it-like-it-is name. He was high camp, a
					flamboyantly gay hairdresser/rocker or <span class="italic">something</span>—you
					didn’t know what he did exactly. He was this outrageous person saying outrageous
					stuff. Who cared what he did?</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">He wore pseudomod clothes, and in person he was
					just as over-the-top as he was on TV. “Come on back to my house, darlings,” he
					said. “I really got some shit goin’ on there!” We get to his place and there’s
					two Great Danes, a chimpanzee, and a defanged cobra—but it still bit you. Oh,
					and never mind the fucking freak folks that were there. Here we are, pubescent
					punks coming down from Yonkers. We hadn’t a clue. Debbie Benson was gorgeous, we
					were cute kids, and here we were among these flaming <span class="italic"
						>queens</span>. Someone starts passing around handfuls of Placidyls. “Here,
					have some of these!” They were fucking paralytic downers, sleeping pills. Monty
					had a hot tub in his living room. I ended up knocking the plug out of his tub.
					After the water drained out, I threw some pillows in and slept there.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“Jim’ll be here soon,” Monty said. Jim fucking
					Morrison was coming over? We all awaited his arrival like that of a god. He came
					late, and by the time he got there, we were so wasted we thought it was Van
					Morrison. We were in some place where words melted into sounds, and Jim was out
					there .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. even further! It scared the shit out of us. We were so
					terrified, we hid in the bedroom, then wound up getting under the sheets with a
					candle, just shaking because we were so fucking stoned. It was all so freaky; we
					were scared what the chimpanzee might do to the Great Danes, let alone what
					Monty had in mind for Morrison.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">We were in no shape to walk <span class="italic"
						>or</span> talk. We took more Placidyls and fell out around two in the
					morning .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. totally zonked. Around 5:00 <span class="sc">A.M</span>.
					we woke up. Debbie was crying. “These aren’t my clothes,” she said. “What do you
					mean,” I said. “You’re wearing the same dress you had on last night.” Her eyes
					were glassy. “But these aren’t my <span class="italic">panties</span>!” Omigod!
					I looked down and thought, what the fuck? “You know what? These aren’t my pants,
					either.” We were running down the stairs, Debbie crying, “I’ve been violated!
					I’ve been violated!” Shit, we’d all wanted to take a walk on the wild side, but
					this was a little bit more than we bargained for.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="sbdropcap">T</span>he thing
					about the British Invasion bands is that they were like gangs—especially the
					Rolling Stones and the Who. Unlike the Beatles, they looked defiant and
					menacing, guys you wouldn’t mess with. I’d like to attribute this insight about
					groups and gangs to the Stones with their collective leathery eyeball, but I’d
					already figured this out long before the Beatles arrived, when the gang I was in
					turned into my first band.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">How do you get into a gang? You act tough—and I’ve
					always been good at the acting part, anyway. I wasn’t tough. I was skinny and
					scrawny and into my own weird world. Acting tough is easy: you just try and be
					as obnoxious as you can and get the shit beaten out of you for it. Throw in a
					few stupid and illegal things—like running across Central Avenue naked, stealing
					stuff for the clubhouse—and if they’re feeling kindly they’ll let you in.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">At Roosevelt there was this guy Ray Tabano who was
					to become my lifelong friend. We first became friends from my telling him to get
					the fuck out of <span class="italic">my</span> tree (the one he was climbing).
					“Stay off my vines,” I yelled. I paid for that a couple of days later when he
					beat the shit out of me—but it was worth it because I eventually became a member
					of a gang, really more of a club, called the Green Mountain Boys. With
					membership in a gang you got protection from the more thuggish elements in high
					school. It also attracted girls, who are always into that kind of asshole.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-art-below" xml:lang="en-us">When I was about fourteen, I hung out
					with Ray at his dad’s bar on Morris Park Avenue in the Bronx. Not bad for a
					hangout. He would let us drink beer. A local Bronx R &amp; B group, the Bell
					Notes, used to perform there, and between their sets Ray and I would sing their
					1959 hit “I’ve Had It.” We’d also do the old Leadbelly song “Cotton Fields,” but
					in the collegiate folk song style of the Highwaymen, who had a hit with it in
					1962. Later I would be in a band called the Dantes with Ray that evolved out of
					the Green Mountain Boys (while still playing with the Strangeurs). The
					Strangeurs were more Beatlish and pop; the Dantes darker and Stonesier. I played
					one gig with the Dantes.</p>

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">How the Strangeurs got their first manager and how
					I became the lead singer of the group also came out of the gang in a way—through
					Ray and stolen merchandise. I’d been ripping off stuff from the little Jewish
					corner candy store where I worked as a soda jerk in Yonkers. I’d go down in the
					basement where I did inventory and grab candy bars and packets of cigarettes and
					give them to Ray to sell. I then progressed to the Shopwell supermarket on
					Central Avenue—bigger items, boxes and crates. Peter Agosta was the store
					manager, and to prevent me from moving stuff out of the back of the store and
					handing it to Ray, he had me collect the shopping carts, so he could have me
					where he could keep an eye on me. Why he didn’t just fire me I’ll never know. I
					told him I was in a band, and he said he’d like to see us play, so I said I’d
					invite him to the next gig we played, which turned out to be a Sweet Sixteen
					party for Art Carney’s daughter. It was a gig my dad had gotten us (he taught
					piano to Carney’s son). Peter Agosta liked the group, but he thought I should be
					the lead singer—oh yeah! We got Barry Shapiro to play drums.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">This was the era of spacey rock. The Byrds’ truly
					cosmic single “Eight Miles High” came out in March 1966. It vibrated in your
					brain like you were tripping. It was blacklisted by radio stations because it
					was thought to be a drug song—duh!—despite Jim McGuinn’s unconvincing
					explanations that it wasn’t. I’ll tell you what “Eight Miles High” <span
						class="italic">was .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. </span>a stratospheric Rickenbacker
					symphony!</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Soon Ray Tabano and I moved on to other
					quasi-criminal activities. To support our pot-smoking habit, we began selling
					nickel bags: buy an ounce for twenty dollars, sell four, keep two for ourselves.
					This was a cool deal and a cheap way of getting high until .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">They put an undercover narc (who will remain
					nameless) in our high school ceramics class. The fucking <span class="italic"
						>ceramics</span> class! He popped us eventually, but first he was <span
						class="italic">selling</span> us nickel bags of good shit he got off some
					other poor fuck he’d popped.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">On June 11, 1966, Henry Smith booked us to play at
					an ice-skating rink in Westport, Connecticut. We rehearsed that afternoon, did a
					sound check. I hoped some people in town would come, because we had a little
					following in Connecticut. I’d met Henry Smith, “the Living Myth,” up in Sunapee
					in the summer of 1965—he became a close friend and a key person in my life. He
					was impressed with our sound when we played the Barn, where we did stuff by the
					Stones like “Everybody Needs Somebody to Love,” the Kinks’ “You Really Got Me,”
					the Byrds’ version of “Mr. Tambourine Man,” and all the current hits. Slam-dunk
					rockers like “Louie, Louie” and “Money.” Henry and his brother, Chris, the
					band’s first photographer, started getting us gigs in Connecticut.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Outside the rink, on the other side of the fence,
					was a trampoline center. I had been on the junior Olympic team in high school
					for trampoline; I could do twenty-six backflips in a row. Not such great form,
					but I could get height from hell.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">For three dollars, you could jump in this
					trampoline park for half an hour. There was nobody there, and I looked around
					and snuck over the fence. I jumped from one trampoline to another, and on to the
					next one. Backflip. I’d probably got through the first six trampolines and on to
					the next row when I heard, “Hey! Get the fuck off my trampolines!” “Listen,
					man,” I said, “we’re playing next door—you want tickets?” His name was Scotty.
					“Oh, you’re in the band that’s playing here tonight?” He loved that. “Why don’t
					you come up to my house?”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I went over to Scotty’s house. Nice pool and a
					fridge full of St. Pauli Girl. We’re swimming and throwing back a few beers when
					these two guys come ripping into the driveway on the two sickest go-carts from
					hell. It’s Paul Newman and <span class="italic">Our Man Flint,</span> James
					Coburn. Holy shit! “Scotty, what’s goin’ on?” I asked. “Oh, that’s my dad,” he
					said. “Which one?” “Paul Newman,” he said. “I’m Scotty Newman, pleased to meet
					you.” “You fucker! When were you gonna tell me?”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Paul Newman was very laid back and as cool as <span
						class="italic">Cool Hand Luke</span>. It was like being in a movie with him.
					I went into the sauna with Paul and Scotty. We’re all sitting in there getting
					sweaty and Paul Newman whips out this bottle of fifty-year-old brandy he’d got
					from the Queen of England, which I downed immediately. I toweled off, put my
					clothes back on, and wandered into the house. There on the mantelpiece was
					Joanne Woodward’s Oscar with its arms folded as all Oscars are. “Where’s yours?”
					I asked Mr. Newman. “Well, I never got one, but my friend made that one up for
					me.” It was a mock Oscar, only with its arms open wide instead of folded and
					with the guy going, “<span class="italic">Vat?</span>” Like, how could you have
					passed me up after all my great performances?</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Twenty minutes later, I got a phone call from my
					mom, completely hysterical. “They found it!” she’s yelling. “Mom, calm down,” I
					said. “What’s goin’ on?” She starts explaining .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and it ain’t
					good. “The cops are here and they found your marijuana! It was in one of your
					books.” Uh-oh, they found my stash so cunningly concealed in a copy of <span
						class="italic">The Hardy Boys and the Disappearing Floor</span>. “Get home
					right now!” I jumped in the car and drove back. I pulled into the driveway and
					saw a black unmarked car approaching from around the corner. My heart fell out
					of my ass. The cops handcuffed me and walked me to the car while I protested my
					innocence. “What are you doing? Why are you arresting me?”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Ah, it never rains but it pours. My dad had come
					home early that day because it was his birthday. “Gee, Dad, Happy Birthday! I
					just wanted to make sure we’re all here to .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” You couldn’t put
					that in a movie. <span class="italic">Action!</span> Have the dad drive up while
					you’re being carted off to jail. It got in the paper. The shame! The Italian
					guilt! “Dad, is there a file in your birthday cake I can borrow?”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">We were taken down to the police station. They’d
					popped a bunch of us, most of the kids in my class. We were giving them the
					finger through the two-way mirror. I’m sitting handcuffed to a bar when this
					fucking guy who had been smoking pot with us walks in flashing his badge: D<span
						class="sc">EPUTY</span> S<span class="sc">HERIFF</span>. The narc was very
					fucking pleased with himself. I was still playing the injured party. “How could
					you have betrayed us like that, you ceramic fuck?” I shouted at him. “You set us
					up!” “They’re gonna throw the book at you, kid,” he said as he walked away.
					Well, not the book, but maybe a couple of chapters. The narc who busted us was
					on a vendetta—his brother had died of an OD, and we were the unfortunate victims
					of his moral crusade.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">At the hearing I asked if I could speak to the
					judge privately. I’d seen enough <span class="italic">Perry</span>
					<span class="italic">Mason</span> episodes to know about consultations in the
					judge’s chambers .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and once you’re in there you can tell him
					whatever the fuck you like. I told the judge that this guy, this narc—not me—was
					the criminal. He’d infiltrated our ceramics class and turned us on to grass and
					then busted us for doing it. I said I’d never heard of grass before this, never
					once tried it. “He was handing out joints, I swear, telling us this was the
					latest turn-on. I’m Italian, your honor (conveniently, so was the judge), and
					I’ve always lived by my parents’ moral code, by the sacred beliefs of the
					Catholic Church. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” Ferris Bueller had nothing on me.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-art-below" xml:lang="en-us">I got a reprimand and was put on
					probation. You pay, that’s how the system works. The good news is that the four
					misdemeanors I received put a YO, Youthful Offender, on my draft card—so no
					fucking Vietnam for me. The bad news is .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we’ll get to that in an
					upcoming chapter. I wouldn’t have gone to ’Nam anyway. I was against it.</p>

					down at the musicians in the studio and then hit a button and over the PA they’d
					say, “Hey, um, will you re-sing that?” There was sheet music on a stand. I was
					stunned. This wasn’t like the Stones or the Yardbirds who wrote their own
					material, played their own stuff. They didn’t even know how to tune their
					instruments. The only guy in the band who had a clue about music was the
					keyboard player, Michael Brown. His father, Harry Lookofsky, was a session
					musician and he controlled everything. He was the producer and arranger, and he
					hired the musicians. Michael McKean, who later played David St. Hubbins—the
					blond dude with the meddling girlfriend in <span class="italic">This Is Spinal
						Tap</span>—was one of the studio musicians. Hell, I still have a problem
					with that movie. That woman is too close to the truth I lived (look for
					elaborations on that point later). I sang backup on a couple of Left Banke
					songs, “Dark Is the Bark” and the flip side, “My Friend Today.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">That was my introduction to recording, and I knew
					if they could do it, I could do it. They were <span class="italic">drunk</span>
					all the time, fer chrissakes. I hung out with the bass player, Tommy Finn, at
					his apartment. So here’s me, a kid from Yonkers, hanging out with a bunch of
					guys that have hit singles <span class="italic">and</span> have great pot. I was
					beyond impressed—I was in seventh heaven.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Hendrix had been at Apostolic not long before. God
					himself. “Hendrix was here two months ago .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and he used this mic,”
					the engineer said. “Which one?” I begged. “This Sennheiser pencil mic.” And
					then, casually, he adds, “Yeah, he put it in this girl’s pussy in the bathroom.
					He was fuckin’ her with it!” And I went, “<span class="italic">Whaaattt?</span>
					Hendrix used that mic?” When the engineer turned his back, I sniffed it
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. which gave new meaning to the term <span class="italic">purple
						haze</span>. I guess I looked a little incredulous because he then said,
					“Yeah, listen to this tape! You’re not gonna believe this!” Whereupon he claps a
					pair of headphones to my melon and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">You could hear the squishing noise as Jimi inserts
					the mic into her gynie. And you could hear him going, “Oh, that’s <span
						class="italic">gooooood,</span> man, that’s cool.” And you could hear the
					girl moaning, <span class="italic">“Oh-ohhhh, ohhhhhhh, ohhh, ohhhh.
						.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</span> Then it shifts into an orgasmic octave higher, <span
						class="italic">“O-ohhhhhh, o-oh-oh, oh-ooooooooh!”</span> And he’s done.
					That’s when the Electric Lady’s man says (no shit), “Hey, baby, what’s your name
					again?” “Kathy,” she purrs. I mean, talk about urban legends. With a gearshift!
					I was in a new league now.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="sbdropcap">T</span>he
					Strangeurs were the opening act for every kind of gig from the Fugs at the Café
					Wha? to the Lovin’ Spoonful at the Westchester County Center to an uptown New
					York discotheque like Cheetah. Then, on July 24, 1966, the Strangeurs opened for
					the Beach Boys at Iona College. <span class="italic">Pet Sounds</span> had come
					out in May and blown everybody’s minds. It was sublime and subliminal and
					saturated your brain. After you heard it you were in a different space.
					“Wouldn’t It Be Nice,” with “God Only Knows” on the flip side, had been out only
					a week before our performance and it was all over the radio. They had a
					competition to choose the band that would be the opening act. We played “Paint
					It Black” and sealed the deal. We got to hang out with the Beach Boys. Brian,
					even in those days, was on another sphere, vibrating his Buddha vibe.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I had my first out-of-body religious experience
					that day singing along with the Beach Boys. It was me and six thousand kids from
					Iona College, all singing “California Girls.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">The promoter Pete Bennett (a pretty heavy guy in
					the business) knew me and my bands from watching us play around New York City.
					And I must have been radiating that glow of <span class="italic">Sufi</span>—I
					know I felt like one when he was done talking to me. He asked if we wouldn’t
					mind opening up for the Beach Boys for the next four shows, there and around New
					York City. I said to him, “Let me think for a minute,” and slam-dunked him a big
					fat “YES!”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Through Peter Agosta we got our first recording
					contract. Agosta knew Bennett, who eventually became promotional manager for the
					Beatles at Apple and worked with Elvis, Frank Sinatra, the Stones, and Dylan.
					Pete Bennett arranged for us to audition for executives at Date Records, which
					was a division of CBS. Back in those days you brought your equipment up in the
					freight elevator and set up in the boardroom and played. We did a couple of
					numbers, and then they went and got one of their producers, Richard Gottehrer,
					who eventually ran Sire Records with Seymour Stein. Gottehrer offered us a deal:
					six thousand dollars. Okay, we’ll take it.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">We did a song called “The Sun,” kind of
					Lennon-McCartney pop. It came out in ’66 and got a little play, but didn’t do
					that great here. It was a big hit in Europe: “Le Soleil,” they called it. It was
					about staying up all night and watching the sun come up in the morning.</p>

				<p class="x1song-last" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">It comes once a day and
						not more.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">It was definitely one of Don Solomon’s finest
					moments. The flip side was “When I Needed You,” a little harder rock, a little
					more experimental .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. our version of the Yardbirds. At this point we
					had to change our name again—CBS was concerned that our weird spelling, the
					Strangeurs, wasn’t different enough from the other Strangers and we might get
					sued. So we became the Chain Reaction, which is a continuous, unstoppable flow
					of energy.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">During this time, I moved out of my house in
					Yonkers to West Twenty-first Street, the only blue building on the block. There
					I lived with Lynn Collins, a gorgeous blonde whom I stole away from my guitar
					player, Marvin Patacki. In ’69 I saw Zeppelin at the Tea Party. When the band
					came offstage, I went back to say hello to the guys, ’cause Henry Smith was
					working for Bonzo, and who do you think comes walking out of the dressing room
					on Jimmy Page’s arm? Lynn Collins. She was a genuine, high-class
					girl-about-rock-’n’-roll-town. I thought to myself, “If I was gonna lose her,
					might as well be to a legend like Page.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Eventually, Henry became our first roadie (whom we
					could pay), and because he lived in Westport, Connecticut, a richer side of the
					tracks than I came from, he could get us better-class gigs. Henry would book the
					Chain Reaction into these gigs we could have never booked ourselves, like
					opening for Sly and the Family Stone, opening for the Byrds, and the coup de
					grâce, opening for the Yardbirds. Jimmy Page was on bass, Jeff Beck was on lead
					guitar, and we were in seventh heaven. We drove up in my mother’s station wagon
					with our equipment. The Yardbirds had a van. We pulled out our gear and put it
					on the sidewalk while they took theirs out. They had some fantastic equipment,
					so I made this little joke, like “Let’s not get it mixed up.” I saw Jimmy Page
					struggling with his amp and I said, “I’ll help you with that.” Hence: “I was a
					roadie for the Yardbirds.” At least it gave me something to talk about while
					Aerosmith was getting its wings in the early days.</p>

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Oddly enough, three years later, Henry Smith, still
					working for us as a full-time roadie this time, gets a phone call from his
					old-time buddy Brad Condliff at the front door to the club in Greenwich Village
					called Salvation, asking Henry if he wanted to help out his old buddy Jimmy Page
					with his recently formed band, the New Yardbirds (always respect the guy at the
					door). Henry grabbed a ticket to London and his only possession at that time, a
					large toolbox covered with stickers with only enough room for a pair of
					underwear, which he stuffed in behind his ounce of pot, and headed off to Europe
					to help his friend with this new band that over that summer became Led
					Zeppelin.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Everybody likes to overblow their past, including
					me—to squeeze out the relevance of what may or may not have really taken place.
					And when you’re just starting out, any story will do. Beck was on guitar, Jimmy
					Page on bass—it was the Yardbirds’ second incarnation (after Eric Clapton left),
					an unbelievable, unstoppable, funky, overamped R&amp;B machine. “Train Kept
					a-Rollin’ ” was bone-rattling .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. there was steam and flames coming
					out of it, and the whole place quaked like a Mississippi boxcar on
					methadrine.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Every morning before school I’d fill a plastic cup
					with Dewar’s whiskey or vodka and down it. I used to dry my hair before school
					to “Think About It,” the last single the Yardbirds did. I’d get the vacuum
					cleaner, take the hose, and stick it in the exhaust socket so it blew out
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. turn it on, go upstairs, and eat breakfast. By the time I got
					back downstairs, the vacuum cleaner was warm and I could blow-dry my wet hair to
					look like a Brian Jones bubblehead. Got to have good <span class="italic"
						>ha-air</span>! I used to sew buttons to the sides of my cowboy boots, and
					at the bottom of the inside leg of my pants I would tie three or four loops of
					dental floss and attach those to the buttons on the boots so that my pants would
					never ride up. I loved doing that sort of thing! I was a rabid rock fashion dog.
					So I went to school, spending an hour getting ready every morning, and ended up
					getting shit for it. I wound up in the principal’s office every day. “Tallarico,
					you look like a girl,” the man would say. I’d tried to explain, “It’s part of my
						<span class="italic">job</span> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. rock musician, sir.” That
					got me absolutely nowhere.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">From winter ’66 into spring ’67, Chain Reaction
					continued to get good gigs—in part through Pete Bennett. We played record hops
					with the WMCA Good Guys. We opened for the Left Banke, the Soul Survivors, the
					Shangri-Las, Leslie West and the Vagrants, Jay and the Americans, and Frank
					Sinatra, Jr. Little Richard emceed one of our shows—the original possessed
					character always doing that crazy shit. He was so fucking out there. He could
					get so high and still function. I don’t know how the fuck he did it! He was
					doing amyl nitrate. That’s scary stuff. There aren’t a lot of drugs I’ve
					refused, but with that shit I was, like, “I’m outta here!”</p>
				<p class="x1bm-art-below" xml:lang="en-us">Pete Bennett wanted to get rid of the
					band and just represent me, but I wouldn’t do it, even though Chain Reaction was
					already winding down. After three years I’d definitely had it with covering
					Beatles tunes. I was already thinking about a hard rock band. Our last gig was
					at the Brooklawn Country Club in Connecticut on June 18, 1967. We made one more
					single, which came out on Verve the following year: “You Should Have Been Here
					Yesterday” and “Ever Lovin’ Man.” And that was that—the Chain stopped
					a-rollin’.</p>

					Chain: me, Don Solomon, and Frankie Ray, 1968. (Ernie Tallarico)</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">In the summer of 1967 I found myself up in Sunapee
					with no band and wondering what to do next. I’d been a local star with records
					on the jukebox, but now kids were asking me, “Where you guys playin’?” Later on
					that summer I formed another band called William Proud, with Twitty Farren on
					lead guitar. Twitty used to play acoustic guitar and sing at the Anchorage with
					a guy named Smitty. Twitty and Smitty were a major thing in New Hampshire. They
					covered Simon and Garfunkel to the T, nailing uncanny versions of “Sounds of
					Silence.” We played out in Southampton for the summer, and while we were there
					wrote “Somebody,” which is on the first Aerosmith album. I collaborated with Don
					Solomon on most of the early Chain Reaction songs, but with the song “Somebody”
					(which I cowrote with Steve Emsback), I realized I could truly compose a good
					song. The inner voice was wailing, “Let’s get cracking here!”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“When I Needed You,” the flip side of the first
					Chain Reaction single, had a Yardbirdish tinge to it, but “Somebody” was
					straight Yardbirds. The Yardbirds were so strange and unpredictable. They could
					make a pop song like “For Your Love” (with its minor key) sound dirgelike and
					ominous. We’re talkin’ fucked-up time-traveling R&amp;B monks. Gregorian chants!
					Outlandish Australian wobble-board percussion! Harpsichords and bongos! <span
						class="italic">They virtually invented the rock solo as an end unto
						itself</span>. The Yardbirds used minor thirds and fourths like alchemists.
					They were really the first progressive rock band, with their use of Eastern
					melodies on “Over Under Sideways Down,” the howling sirens on “Happenings Ten
					Years Time Ago.” I loved their weirdness and their mystery.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">When Henry Smith was working for Zeppelin, Jimmy
					Page would blow his speakers and Henry would send them to me. I had two huge
					deer antlers I got from New Hampshire from eight-point bucks, and I put one on
					the left headboard post of my bed and the other on the right. I’d put my
					speakers there and painted them with thick phosphorescent paint—five or six
					coats—so that when you held a lamp to them, they would glow forever
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well for at least ten or fifteen minutes, but if you smoked pot
					or took hallucinogens, as we did in high school, that was enough.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I’d draw mustaches on the Beatles and Stones
					posters and put phosphorescent paint all along the drawers and the knobs of the
					dressers, so when I went to bed at night, the room was a psychedelic cave! I put
						<span class="italic">dots, </span>like, all along the edge of the chest of
					drawers and the molding. Dot, dot, dot (maybe <span class="italic">that’s
					</span>where my .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. thing started), then a nice big fat one, and I
					did it all over the room with phosphorescent paint, six coats, so it was that
					thick—to hold the light.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">In the middle of the room at the end of my bed, I
					had a twelve-foot span (from the door to the window) of fifteen thick rubber
					bands knotted together—which could really stretch out—and in the middle I
					attached a five-ounce sinker dipped ten times in phosphorescent paint, so it
					glowed like a fucking red-hot poker. When you let go of the sinker, the linked
					rubber bands would bounce like crazy .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. swinging in slo-mo, back
					and forth across the room .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and you’d be <span class="italic">Star
						Trek</span>-trippin’. By the time I was done, when I was, like, seventeen or
					eighteen and getting ready to move out, my room was a masterpiece. You were in
					this realm of pulsing phosphorescent light between the speakers. I would smoke a
					joint, bring the linked rubber bands all the way over to one side of the room,
					and let it go back and forth, right? ’Cause it was right in the middle.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Then I’d crank up the Association, Pretty Things,
					Brownie McGhee, Sonny Boy Williamson, and all this weird early German
					electronica stuff. I’d invite my friends over and they’d get wrapped up in my
					phosphorescent audio wonderland.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="sbdropcap">I</span> went up
					to the Woodstock Festival with Don Solomon and Ray Tabano a day or so early. We
					told them we were Ten Years After—you never know when that Brit accent is going
					to come in handy—and they let us in. We made our way through the woods to the
					Hog Farm. The Hog Farm was the name of Wavy Gravy’s commune in Tujunga,
					California—the longest-running hippie commune of the sixties. It eventually
					became what they called “a mobile hallucinatory extended family”—now that’s the
					kind of extended family I wanted to join. The Hog Farm got involved in the
					Woodstock Festival to make trails, dig fire pits, and provide a food kitchen.
					The trail through the woods was called Groovy Way, a quarter-mile path hung with
					Christmas lights.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">When I went to Woodstock, I was tripping my brains
					out. Everyone always says, “Woodstock, Woodstock—were you there?” but the funny
					thing is .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. half the people who were there didn’t know <span
						class="italic">where </span>they were. I walked over to the stage area from
					the Hog Farm through a strip of woods with multicolored holiday bulbs running
					through them. I was so high they were like the mother ship zinging messages to
					me. And we wouldn’t just do <span class="italic">one</span> tab .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
					I’d already snorted another. <span class="italic">Can </span>you snort acid? My
					friend Ray knew Owsley. He would call him on the phone with advice on how to
					improve the product: “Dude, more colors! More colors!” As high as I was, I
					could’ve met the Buddha, Murf the Surf, and the Tooth Fairy, and I wouldn’t have
					turned a hair.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Now, who I <span class="italic">really</span> would
					have liked to bump into walking down Groovy Way making her merry way down the
					path was Janis fuckin’ Joplin! But it was enough just knowing she was there at
					Woodstock. When I saw Janis sing she blew my mind. Everybody used to think Mick
					was my real hero, but I’ll confess now (’cause that’s what a memoir is for,
					right?), <span class="italic">it was Janis.</span> The scarves on the mic, the
					howl .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. inspired and perspired by pure 180-proof Joplin. She’s bone
					deep and still makes me weep. Cole Porter, Nat King Cole .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the
					divine vibratos of my youth .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but none finer nor more sacred than
					Saint Janis.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">And then—this is so amazing!—who do I run into on
					Groovy Way but Joey Kramer! Joey had been in a band called the King Bees, which
					was a younger version of the Dantes. Something I’ll never forget, ever,
					colliding at Woodstock .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. both tripping our asses off. I <span
						class="italic">loved</span> the hallucinations; I loved that vibrating,
					molecular trance. The molecules that are dancing through your body, your hands
					giving off sparks. Altered states? <span class="italic">Please!</span>
					Psychedelics take you places you can’t go on the natch.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">One of my literary gurus was Aldous Huxley, who
					wrote <span class="italic">The Doors of Perception </span>based on his
					experimentations with mescaline. He was hip to the whole cosmological, folktale
					realm that is under the radar of the, um, mundane world. Ah, how did spots get
					on trout? The Raven did it! Coyote laughed and it rained for twelve years. Those
					stories. As a youth, it was, “Wow, what a brilliant mind!” Some of those fuckin’
					guys—Coleridge, de Quincey—were on laudanum (Victorian smack), too! But really,
					any of these seekers and freakers, because their thoughts are out of the box,
					out of their heads .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you know there had to be something wrong with
					them. There’s always been something wrong with me, too. I’ve always been the
					designated patient, clinically speaking, and therefore the bad boy, even in
					fucking Aerosmith! <span class="italic">Especially</span> in fucking Aerosmith!
					But we’ll get into deeper <span class="italic">diagnosis</span> of my condition
					later.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">If there’s a fifth, sixth dimension.
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <span class="italic">If?</span> Oh, come<span class="italic">
						on</span>! Anyway, it must be something like what you see on acid. Things
					would vibrate differently. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No kidding! What acid did for me was
					made me think about other planes and possibilities, contemplate things that I
					see and feel that aren’t there. I’ve gone to the wall with that stuff, straight
					and stoned. When I got my new house, I went in, turned all the lights off, sat
					in a chair in the black, infinite not-wisdom, and said, “Bring it on,
					motherfucker! Come on! Come on! Where are you? I’m waiting. ’Cause if you’re
					here .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <span class="italic">be</span> here. And if you do show up
					later, I’m gonna kick your ectoplasmic ass!” You gotta talk tough to demons
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you can’t shilly-shally or they’ll pounce.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">After a couple of days tripping my brains out I was
					crashing into the deep dark pit of apocalyptic blackness. I didn’t know anything
					about dope back then. How great would it have been to snort some heroin while
					you’re coming down from LSD? You’re going into a tailspin, the alien pods have
					drained your synapses, you’re wildly thinking about the deaths of stars.
					Everything is profound and meaningless at the same time. The micros of the
					lysergic acid shrinking the whole universe to the size of a pea—that’s when you
					need a Valium! “T<span class="sc">AKE ONE OR TWO OR THREE</span> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
						<span class="sc">AFTER COMING DOWN FROM AN ACID TRIP</span>.” That’s what it
					should say on the label.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">The morning Hendrix played, Woodstock had become a
					war zone. We were walking about aimlessly, and then I heard <span class="italic"
						>baa-baw-baw-ba-ba-ba,</span> the first notes of the Jimified national
					anthem. It was about three in the morning when he went on. Hendrix was so smart
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he’d been up all night. I saw him walking around like a visitor
					from Xanadu. He played “The Star Spangled Banner” <span class="italic"
						>knowing</span> he’d wake everyone up. That was brilliant! It was like an
					X-ray report from Alpha Centauri to the third stone from the sun.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">After three days of peace, love, music, and massive
					amounts of drugs, Woodstock looked like Vietnam on acid. People were eating
					watermelon rinds; the helicopters were thrumming and hovering everywhere. After
					everybody else had left, the fields all around looked like there’d been a war
					but with no bodies—sleeping bags instead of corpses.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Somebody stole the gas cap to Don Solomon’s car,
					and since it rained for two days, the gas tank got full of water and we couldn’t
					leave. I still have a Coca-Cola cooler that I’d stolen, and I went around
					picking up everybody’s pipes. There’s a banner that hung behind us at Woodstock
					with a stick figure holding a cornucopia and with a dick, or a tail, between his
					legs. I stole that, too. I had Aerosmith’s seamstress, Francine Larness, and her
					sister duplicate it and I still have them.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">At Woodstock I sat and watched Hendrix and Joe
					Cocker and the Who especially. I had those deranged thoughts watching them up
					onstage: “Someday I could be that spectacular.” The experience of the first
					Woodstock totally outweighed the second one that we played at in 1994. We had
					all those people backstage, and the press is coming to you. Every time I went
					out of my trailer there were millions of flash cubes in my face. It wasn’t my
					idea of Woodstock. I would rather have been out there rolling around in the mud.
					Had I been there as a spectator, I’d have been fucked-up and had that experience
					again.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">At the original Woodstock I was in a tent, and
					suddenly the tent was making this warping noise from the helicopter blades—it
					was shivering—it was <span class="italic">alive</span>! I went outside, my brain
					on LSD. I was tripping my ass off. I was atomized, sparks were flying off me
					like a Roman candle, and fuck me if it wasn’t raining frankfurters! <span
						class="italic">Incoming</span>! The helicopter was talking to me: “GET OUT OF THE WAY!” it said, like Jehovah out of a cloud,
					except it was army helicopters dropping six hundred pounds of hot dogs (and pots
					and pans to cook them) in huge nets. They would hover ten feet off the ground
					and let their payload drop. I went over and I picked up a pot .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
					and started drumming. Then another guy came over and he did the same. Pretty
					soon, a dozen people banging on pots, then two dozen .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. three. Ken
					Kesey was there banging on a pot! The original bona fide hippie drum circle. And
					the beat would change as people dropped out and came in and dropped out and came
					in again. This went on for days .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or at least hours that <span
						class="italic">seemed</span> like days.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">The Vietnam War was terrible, but we made peace by
					smoking pot. That’s something that we don’t have today. It’s all fucking Ecstasy
					and clubs and, er, fucking. Back then you passed a joint, and it was “make love,
					not war.” Everybody was your friend. You’d make eye contact with someone and end
					up smoking a joint with them. You started talking sweet and beautiful shit. In
					the sixties everyone had a common ground .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and pot and the drugs
					were a big fuckin’ part of it. There’s your triangulation: Pot, Rock, Vietnam
					(and civil rights).</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">We used to give the peace sign, and if someone
					nodded, you’d say, “Wanna get high, man? You got a joint?” And it was lovely.
					Today you don’t know what somebody’s thinking. Today, I see people in the street
					and don’t know if they’re going to hug me or mug me. You know, I don’t really
					care if you get on the Internet, text, or Twitter .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we were
					accessing the fucking cosmos! Okay, now I do sound like a character out of a
					Crumb comic—or Oscar the Grouch. But I just figured out why guys like me turn
					into curmudgeons .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the world’s going to hell in a handbasket,
					everybody has rolled over and given up, and there’s no more afternoon
					baseball.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="sbdropcap">I</span>’d drop
					acid and go into the city. You’d look down at the sidewalk and it was <span
						class="italic">melting.</span> I was walking on a great gray, sparkling
					snake. It shivered when you stepped on it. The sidewalk was <span class="italic"
						>alive</span>! And then there was the Electric Circus in the East Village
					with the Rubber Room. I’d take acid and go in there. I <span class="italic"
						>lived</span> there! The Rubber Room was this padded space made for people
					who were tripping, because they were going <span class="italic"
						>“YEE-HAA!”</span> and they didn’t want anybody to hurt themselves.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">One Sheridan Square in the West Village—the Stones
					and the Animals would go there. I’d sit there listening to that song “Judy in
					Disguise (with Glasses)” by John Fred and His Playboy Band.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">It was the beginning of the disco era, and in that
					club they would play the music so fucking loud, and we were in there going,
					“Fuck, this is fucking great!” Clubs with bone-jangling loud music! That was the
					beginning of all of it. And no one sold T-shirts to the revolution. Think about
					that! No one was selling T-shirts in 1971! What were we <span class="italic"
						>thinking</span>?</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">By the late sixties I was seriously into
					Haight-Ashbury. I’d way got over my Mod Mick phase—so had Mick. I was into—I
					don’t want to say my feminine side, but the hipper women’s stuff, the way
					Marianne Faithfull and Anita Pallenberg dressed those guys! They really had that
					motley, tatterdemalion medieval troubadour thing down. Eventually the hip King’s
					Road shops began exporting that stuff, like the New York branch of Granny Takes
					a Trip. As soon as I began to refine my own personal style, I was immediately
					attracted to the Anita Pallenberg/Keith Richards gypsy look. But after I saw
						Janis—<span class="italic">she </span>became my fashion idol.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Eventually Anita and I became good friends. When I
					go over to England I always try to see her. Last time I met her where she works,
					at the designer Vivienne Westwood’s boutique. Vivienne Westwood, now Dame
					Vivienne, designed clothes for the Sex Pistols and then brought her eccentric
					clothing into the mainstream—if you can call her wildlife outfits mainstream. I
					was looking around at the bizarre clothes in the shop when a woman came up
					behind me, covered my eyes, then put her hands around my neck, almost snapped my
					fucking neck off, and said, “Who is this?” “Uh, I give up.” “Your best English
					fucking cunt!” It was Anita in her broken-English Cockney accent.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">A few years ago, when Keith and Anita still lived
					in Bing Crosby’s old house out on Long Island, I went to spend a couple of days
					with them. I’d bought this rare book in a weird little bookstore in New York.
					The guy kept it in the back room; it was about black magic and shit. I took it
					with me. A little light satanic reading for a weekend in the country. It was
					about the derivation of the Seven Sacred Sins and all that dark stuff. When
					Anita found it under my bed, she had a fucking fit. She ripped the book up. When
					I asked her why she did it, she screamed at me in front of Keith, “How <span
						class="italic">dare</span> you bring this into my house? Are you here to
					cast spells on us?” Meanwhile we were all gacked to the nines on coke.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="sbdropcap">T</span>he
					sixties and us, we got away with it. And now, “fuck-all” lives on! You’d read R.
					Crumb and then these characters would be there right before your eyes. You’d go,
					hey, <span class="italic">he’s</span> from R. Crumb. Oh, that was so great! A
					little lame and filthy, but what the hell, R. Crumb had Mr. Natural and, you
					know, Flakey Funt and Angelfood McSpade. Oh, it was just so good.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">At the end of the sixties I lived at Sleepy Hollow
					Restorations, right before the Tappan Zee Bridge. I’d be so <span class="italic"
						>high</span> coming from New York or Yonkers in my car, in my Volkswagen,
					from eating hash brownies and recording records, I would wind up missing the
					exit and drive over the bridge. Whoops! Forgot cash! I’d go over the bridge with
					no money! Problem is, there’s a <span class="italic">toll</span> on the way back
					into New York. I’d drive up and go, “I just don’t got—!” But I was scared to
					death. That happened quite a few times. I remember there was a tree there that
					had such a beautiful face against the sky at sunset.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">At eighteen most kids think about becoming a man.
					Never did! The guy you went to high school with figured it out. Got a job, went
					to work every day. He became a man. But here I was at twenty-two. I was at a
					loss. What was I going to do? Tune pianos like my uncle Ernie or teach music
					like my dad did at Cardinal Spellman High School? I had that moment of
					angst.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“Perplexity,” sayeth my man Kahlil Gibran, “is the
					beginning of knowledge.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Yeah, but he wasn’t living in Sunapee and doing
					crystal meth. I loved speed, man! Remember the speed that burned when you
					snorted it and you had to keep it in the freezer? It was blue and it had that
					terrible smell? “Oh! That tastes terrible!” It was an acquired taste, one that I
					acquired without too much difficulty. You could eat the paper it was wrapped in
					and you were fuckin’ forget-about-it.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I <span class="italic">loved</span> Quaaludes, too.
					Especially when you got too high on speed or blow. Whenever I’d go to rehab,
					they’d say, “Well, you’re always chasing the drug.” And I go, “Yu-uh!” It’s like
					having a fast car and you go really fast, but then occasionally you’ve got to
					stop and go get gas, but while you’re getting gas all you want to do is get back
					in that fast car. It’s like that time again! You have no blow, you run out, you
					go to your dealer and get some more, and then you’re in the car breaking the
					sound barrier and your brains are pouring out of your ears and then someone
					goes, “Here, check this out!” It’s like ethyl alcohol and you hit this button
					and your mind chills down.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">The wildest places we played were fraternities.
					With Fox Chase I played Bones Gate—it was a famous raunchy fraternity at
					Dartmouth they based <span class="italic">Animal House</span> on. At those
					parties I used to sit under the keg, they’d turn the keg on, and I’d beat
					everybody out.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Fox Chase was the last band I was in before
					Aerosmith. Right before that, in 1969, William Proud went out to Long Island and
					I was with them there until that fell apart and I went back up to Sunapee.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I had no money. I was desperate, defeated, doomed.
					I didn’t know what I was going to do with my life. William Proud had played
					every nightclub, grotto, union hall, gym, bar mitzvah, and VFW hall for a
					fifty-mile radius. We were burned out on the trail. Nowhere left to play. It all
					came to a head one night at the last incarnation of Salvation in the Village,
					way out in Southampton on Long Island.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">At the Hampton gig, I practically strangled our
					lead guitar player, Twitty Farren, to death during a rehearsal. Top that, Alice
					Cooper! Midrehearsal, I look up and see Twitty—who was a fuckin’ great guitar
					player, by the way—<span class="italic">yawning</span>. I asked myself, “Is it
					the heat or is it that his heart isn’t in it anymore?” I was high as a kite, and
					I jumped over the drum set to try and choke his raggedy ass, but I fell over my
					high hat and cracked my leg instead.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I ran out of the club, stuck out my thumb, and
					hitchhiked all the way back to New Hampshire .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. drumless, bandless,
					hopeless. But still telling my mom, “Mom, I’m going to be such a big star
					there’s gonna be girls hanging off the rafters, kids coming through the windows,
					battering down the doors. We gotta batten the place down, put up six-foot
					fences, put shutters on the windows. We’ll need an intercom and electric gates
					to keep out the rabid fans. Or else we’ll have to move.” “Of course, Steven.” My
					mom always believed in me, she was a stone romantic.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">William Proud—Peter Bover, Twitty Farren, Mouse
					McElroy, and Eddie Kisler—wasn’t really working out. It was still fun, we still
					got gigs, but it was small potatoes and wasn’t leading to anything. No road to
					destiny! I grew up in a family where we were all very close, and I was probably
					homesick or whatever they call that today.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Summer ended, the town was cold. No one to cop
					from, no drugs, nothing up here—everyone had left. Oil lamps, candles, winter,
					the wind whistling through the pines. No band, no plans, no future, and they
					were starting to roll the sidewalks up. It was my first season of wither. And
					then, <span class="italic">on the seventh hour of the seventh day </span>I heard
					Joe Perry play. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
