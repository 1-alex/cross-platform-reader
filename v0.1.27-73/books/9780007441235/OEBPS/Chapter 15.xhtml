				<p class="x1bm-first" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he press are
					always there, like jackals, hanging around at the gates as the latest celebrity
					drug addict drags his sorry ass into a waiting limo. When I came out of the Chit
					Chat rehab in Wernersville, Pennsylvania, in 1989, it was for the last time—I’d
					hoped. The press asked, with their fake sympathy, “So, how <span class="italic"
						>was</span> it, Steve, getting through all that?”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">The thirty days? Or the forty years it took me to
					get here? I think thirty days is a small price to pay for the rest of my life.
					“If it helped you find your soul again,” I said, “then how can you not owe it
					your life?”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">And then I began to explain, in the way the
					recovering addict is expected to do, with the required contrition and shame. And
					then you give them the promised fairy-tale ending, renewed faith in life after
					the nightmare of addiction and willful self-destruction. All true—I wasn’t just
					mouthing pieties about my road to recovery—but there was something I wasn’t
					saying, not because I was hiding anything but just because it was so weird and
					intimate and ultimately unexplainable. Some of it I missed, some of it I got.
					The fairy-tale links I understood.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">As a child I lived in the woods and I saw where the
					sap to make maple syrup came from, and later on I sought it out. I went and got
					some heroin because I wanted to feel what it was like not just to taste the sap
					from the tree, but to feel it coursing through my veins, opium from Mother
					Earth, the resin of the poppy plant. The gooey nectar of the earth—roots,
					tendrils growing out of the damp, humid soil. Unconsciously I connected the pine
					trees, the unearthly silence of the woods I had played in, with the opium I
					numbed myself with—as if the two linked a secret passage back to my
					childhood.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">But my romance with opium and heroin and drugs of
					all kinds was over. Or so I thought. Though I lived on the tail of a comet and
					though I came from a town called Euphoria. In 2007 I left my home for a world
					tour. Everything was fine. I was feeling no pain. Why? After twelve years of
					being straight, I’d started using painkillers again because I was in terrible
					pain from my feet.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-art-below" xml:lang="en-us">On May 31, 2007, we played to forty
					thousand people at the Dubai Exiles Rugby Club stadium in Dubai, Saudi Arabia.
					It was so hot there we couldn’t play until eleven o’clock at night when the
					temperature had gone down to eighty, eighty-five degrees. I greeted the crowd in
					Arabic. Okay, one word, <span class="italic">marhaba!</span> (welcome), but
					still .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">The day of the concert, Erin and I went out into
					the desert with Sand Dune Explorers, camelback tour rides. We rented five trucks
					and took along a bunch of people from the hotel, security, and a truckload full
					of camera gear and stuff for a photo shoot. The SUVs were <span class="italic"
						>flying</span> up and down the dunes, some thirty feet high, like we were
					surfing great sand waves. They have to let the air out of the tires to get
					traction on the sand. We drove for twenty minutes into the great unknown of sand
					and sand and more sand. It was 110 degrees out there. If I’d been left out there
					I wouldn’t know where in hell I was. It’s just a sea of sand, like being in the
					middle of the ocean. Sandstorms in the desert come up out of nowhere and hit so
					fast, they’re tsunamis of sand, and when that happens you’re not only lost,
					you’re blinded.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">A group of Bedouins was crossing the dunes on
					camels. I was curious about how they found their way around out there, so we
					drove over to talk to them. Some of these camels cost more than a Lamborghini.
					One of the Bedouins told me that the camel he was riding on was a dromedary of a
					very high strain and worth two hundred thousand dollars. There are racing camels
					worth over a million dollars. I asked him, “How do you know where you’re going
					out here, with no landmarks, no signs?” And he goes, “Well, the camels know—if
					you’re lost the camel will take you back.” “Ah, no wonder the price!” I’d pay
					it, too; it’s fucking life-threatening out there.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">And not only do camels have their own GPS sensors,
					they also invented butter. Yeah, they did. When the Bedouins carried milk across
					the desert in goatskin bags, they found that it had turned into a
					solid—butter—when they got to the other side. But I prefer the account of the
					invention of butter in <span class="italic">Little Black Sambo, </span>a book my
					mother read to me (it wasn’t as politically incorrect when I was growing up as
					it is today). They were fantastic tales and great fun. Sambo was a little boy
					from India. Four hungry tigers are pursuing him, and in order to avoid being
					eaten by them he has to give them his colorful new clothes, his shoes, and his
					umbrella. Each one of the jealous, conceited tigers wants the clothes and
					umbrella for itself, and they begin to chase each other around a tree, going
					faster and faster until their orange and white stripes begin to blend and they
					end up a pool of delicious butter.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I’ve often wondered if I could be turned into
					something like that when I pass away. Instead of burying me in a family plot
					somewhere they could scatter my ashes all over the sand of Big Beach in Maui.
					That way after I’m dead I’d still be getting into girls’ bikini bottoms.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-art-below" xml:lang="en-us">We came offstage around two in the
					morning—all I wanted to do was decompress. I was looking forward to walking
					around the town, going to the marketplace in Dubai, just being somewhere I’d
					never been before. I get back to the room and go to bed. The next morning I wake
					up and I <span class="italic">hurt</span> like hell. I’m in excruciating pain
					from <span class="italic">my feet</span>. My feet are screaming at me, “What the
					hell were you thinking last night? You trashed us!” The night before I’d been
					running, leaping, levitating onstage for two hours as the pointman for
					Aerosmith—but the point was I trashed my feet, and now, the day after, I’m
					paying the price. And we still had concerts to play in Sweden, Germany, England,
					Ireland, Latvia, Estonia, Finland, and Russia—not to mention twelve dates in
					Canada and the U.S.</p>

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">On June 2 we played India! We had always wanted to
					play India, and in 2007 we got to do a concert in Bangalore. India has been a
					huge part of my life. I named my son, Taj, in part for the Taj Mahal. I wrote

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I love Indian food, Indian incense, Indian printed
					fabrics—onstage at Bangalore I wrapped myself in yards of batik print shawls
					(leather pants and a black ganji top, for the fashionistas).</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">One of my favorite books is Rudyard Kipling’s <span
						class="italic">Kim. </span>Snake charmers, levitating yogis, many-armed blue
					gods and goddesses, roaming elephants with silk towers on which maharajas ride,
					temples covered with statues of couples caressing, copulating, doing the wild
					thing in a thousand yoni positions. And the <span class="italic">Kama
						Sutra</span>—the bible of sex! And in honor of Shakti, Hindu goddess of love
					and the unknowable feminine, I stripped halfway through the show to bare my
					stomach, on which I’d written “LICK ME!” in Hindi. I think it meant more to me
					than it did them.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I discovered the erotic origin of yoga while
					reading about Tantric sex some fifteen years ago when I was into meditation. And
					it turns out that yoga was originally created so that the maharaja could stay
					harder for a longer period of time so as not to let any of the harem girls down.
					He had seven or eight beautiful girls in his harem. The first girl, whom he’d
					got when he was younger .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. was now the taskmaster to the other
					girls, and with a gold-braided whip she trained them to do things to excite the
					maharaja’s pleasure. They had to adopt ways for the marahaja to exercise. He had
					to stand on his head for hours in the hot sun just to be able to meet them
					adequately with his manliness. His temple guards saw him doing this and thought
					there is an easier way. They knew just what the maharaja liked: the perfect
					plump ass, nice firm breasts, a tight sweet yoni—but as we know, it goes deeper
					than that. All is good in the palace, but after five or ten years of this life,
					with all these women at his beck and call, his back is killing him from
					servicing all the palace <span class="italic">punani</span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
					and what is he to do? Well, one day, the maharaja was sitting under a palm tree
					eating a date when his old teacher, a wise and horny old sage appeared, a Sufi
					master bringing some hash and the special dates with the almonds in the
					middle—whatever exquisite treats it takes to get through to the maharaja and not
					get your head chopped off. “Ah, Babu,” he says, “just the man I want to see!” “I
					hear you, oh great panjandrum, and I have just the thing: yoga. If you follow my
					practical <span class="italic">asana</span> exercisings—the Cat-Cow stretch, the
					Downward-Facing Dog pose, the Awkward Chair pose, and the Half Lord of Fishes
					pose—you will be able to fuck all the girls till kingdom come and you will not
					have a single twinge in your spine.” And the maharaja was well pleased with this
					advice and said, “We could have a chain of yoga centers in the United States of
					America and make a fortune with this silly business and the confused seekings of
					the baby boomers!”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">We arrived at the Bengaluru International Airport
					in Bangalore, India, and were greeted by a thousand Indian fans who took us by
					surprise. We were whisked into limousines and headed off to the hotel. But as we
					were to find out it was much more than a hotel. When we arrived, a ten-foot gate
					opened to reveal a full-on hundred-piece Indian marching band complete with
					giant elephant for us to ride to our rooms.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">The elephants dropped us off, and Erin and I walked
					into our room. There was a big bowl of mangoes and papayas and anything your
					heart desires awaiting us. Beautiful arrangements of tropical flowers, a prince
					of a man is standing outside our door to be ready at our beck and call to
					fulfill our slightest whim. “Steven” is embroidered on the pillowcases, I kid
					you not. “God,” I said to Erin, “pinch me. When are we gonna wake up?” She said,
					“The way things are I hope we never do.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">We got to the Palace Grounds for the sound check.
					That’s where the concert was to take place. Once outside the hotel, the scenes
					were horrifying: mobs of desperate, hungry people milling around with begging
					bowls asking for coins, people pooping in the street and dogs eating the
					poop.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“So sorry but sound check delayed,” said the
					promoter.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“Why is that?” I asked.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“Well, you see, we are just now testing <span
						class="italic">it</span> for you.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“Testing <span class="italic">what</span>?” He
					pointed to the stage. So I walked down and looked underneath the stage: sticks!
					It was just a great mass of sticks, twigs no bigger than your thumb. It was
					stronger than it sounds because they were lashed together like a geodesic dome.
					It was never going to break, but it was scary-looking and we had a ton of sound
					and lights and equipment.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">The promoter of the Bangalore concert was even more
					ruthless than your average scummy promoters in the United States. He confiscated
					water, booze, and food from everyone and then made them pay ten dollars for a
					bottle of water and there’s eighty thousand people at the concert—so do the
					math. The worst part was that he didn’t offer to cut me in! The guy said, “I
					make beer. I own all alcohol here in Bangalore Province. We take all the bottles
					away before they come in.” There’s a ton of booze and water bottles piled up in
					a huge heap. I said, “What do you do with all those bottles?” “Oh, we dump
					them.” “What about all the destitute people walking the streets outside our
					hotel like zombies at four in the morning, barefoot, in loin cloths, with no
					food?” “As Ramakrishna says, ‘When an elephant is in trouble, even a frog can
					kick him.’ ”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Three hours later, we’re back in our room, Erin
					turns on the TV, and there’s an Indian announcer in the singsongy voice
					describing our room as the camera pans around to the bowl of fruit, the bed
					(without us in it), but the pillows with “Steven” stitched on them, my bathrobe,
					and the towels (also with “Steven” on them). We sat up, “Whoa! Is this camera in
					here <span class="italic">now</span>?” They’d been in the room the day before
					and filmed everything.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Onstage, Joey’s always tied to his drums, and Tom,
					Brad, and Joe are all ferociously focused on their fret boards—they can’t be
					running around like maniacs—so it’s up to me to put on a show. I’m the
					designated kinetic animal, the leaper, the somersaulter, the jack-in-the-box,
					the March Hare driven to mad extremes by the manic artillery of Aerosmith’s
					heavy-ordnance rock. And my poor feet having had to bear the burden of all these
					acrobatic antics for thirty-six years finally said, “NO MORE! If you don’t treat
					me good the way you should, you won’t have a leg to stand on.” Okay, I get it!
					What was wrong with my foot? It sloped to one side, it looked oddly reptilian,
					like it had turned into an alien pod. I dealt with it the same way I’ve always
					dealt with pain—I self-medicated. It took me a while to get around to having my
					feet examined (I should’ve had my head examined, too). When I finally went to
					see an orthopedic specialist, Dr. Brian McKeon at the Boston Sports and Shoulder
					Center, he said, “Son, what you got ain’t good!” What he actually said was
					something like “It’s an enlarged nerve that usually occurs in the third
					interspace, between the fourth and fifth toes. Problems often develop in this
					area because part of the lateral plantar nerve combines with part of the medial
					plantar nerve here.” Okay, stop! I’ve heard enough! It had a nasty-ass name:
					Morton’s neuroma. It sounded bad and it was.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">My feet were crooked and broken from years of
					wearing tight shoes and high-heeled boots—Beatles boots—and slamming around
					onstage. That’s why I walk this way. It’s one thing to walk around all day in
					high heels like women do, but to traumatize your feet onstage for two hours
					every night for thirty years is quite another. We played <span class="italic"
						>thousands</span> of shows, my feet and I. After every tour, my feet weren’t
					just inflamed, they were <span class="italic">in shock</span>.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">In February of ’07 I was a busy boy. We’d gone to
					London to perform at the Hard Rock Cafe, where I put on one of John Lennon’s
					jackets. We were there to promote our upcoming world tour and to rip the Hard
					Rock another asshole with our badass selves. It was the first gig Tom played
					after having recovered from throat cancer. The show was fucking great and I was
					on fire from hanging out with the Bert and Ernie of England, our photographers,
					Ross Halfin and <span class="italic">Classic Rock</span> magazine’s Peter
					Makowski, who I later had dinner with—along with Jimmy Page. Not only do I have
					to perform, I have do BBC One and BBC Two interviews: “Now, tell me, Steven, how
					are you and those drug addictions doing? Are you and Joe still the Toxic Twins?”
					Where have they been? Fuck, they missed my whole sobriety thing. <span
						class="italic">What! </span>Twelve years of me clean, sober, drug free, and
					reasonable (well, okay, maybe that’s going a bit too far) and you <span
						class="italic">missed </span>it, you fucks? On to the inevitable Mick
					look-alike questions and the more recent taunt, “By the way, how <span
						class="italic">old</span> are you?” I just went, “You sensationalistic
					motherfuckers. I don’t mean that in a bad way.” They just laughed; they loved
					it. I was, after all, a visiting dignitary and it was all really sweet.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">At the Brit awards I was asked to copresent the
					Best International Group award to the Killers, along with Sophie Ellis Bextor.
					Amy Winehouse, my sister in the art of self-destruction and abuse, showed up to
					greet me. The guys from the Red Hot Chili Peppers came to my dressing room and I
					felt bad because most of them were clean and I was still crusin’. “How’re you
					doin’?” I asked Anthony Kiedis, and he goes, “Well, I’m still ridin’ the
					sobriety train.” And shamefully, I blurted out, “Yeah, me too!” but I was
					snorting Zanzibars at the time like there was no tomorrow. I did an absolutely
					manic interview with the Brit classic rock magazine <span class="italic"
						>MOJO</span>. I raved on about God, gorillas, talking dogs, and sex in
					trees.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">The thing about my feet was that I knew they were
					going to require surgery and that it was going to be fucking painful as hell,
					because I knew the band would force me to rush my recovery in order to get back
					out on tour in a timely manner. My doctor works on all the Celtics’ and Bruins’
					knees and shoulders and feet, and he put me in Larry Byrd’s room. I was in the
					hospital for a week-plus while I had the foot operations. What they had to do
					was to cut some bone and take two knuckles out of my feet (they’re in a similar
					position to the knuckles in your hand). If you bend your thumb above the nail,
					that’s one knuckle, the next knuckle back is where the thumb attaches to the
					hand, and that was the joint in my foot that had to be sawed in half because it
					was bent. They also took out a ganglion of nerves. The nerves that are in your
					feet are small as a dime, but mine were the size of a quarter, big and bulbous
					and traumatized to the point where they had to be taken out. Morton’s neuroma is
					the nerve center in the feet. That’s where they took the nerves out, so now
					there’s just phantom pain there, like a guy who gets his arm cut off and still
					feels his fingers. <span class="italic">Whatha?</span> So there’s phantom pain
						<span class="italic">plus</span> my brain is sending electricity down to the
					feet thinking that Nerve Central’s still there. What Dr. McKeon did was to take
					the Grand Central Station of nerves in my feet out.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Even four months later I was still walking on those
					incisions; it’s something that I need to do because it makes nerves spark and
					come back to life and return life to my foot again. The doc said that in a year
					it should be just plain all right. I’ve got a couple of places that are creaking
					and hurting still and I don’t know why. Love may be hard on the knees, but it’s
					also hard on the vocal cords and the feet—and my ankle muscles aren’t back,
					either. I’ll be in pain for the rest of my life. Hey, what else is new?</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">When I got out of the hospital I kept my feet
					elevated and got a little roller device to do my orthopedic exercises on. I also
					got a scooter on four wheels that I’d kneel on and scoot around the house. I put
					a horn on it so I could blast everyone as I zoomed around the house. But because
					it’s my feet and because of who I am, you can only imagine, after a month and a
					half, I climbed up the stairs on my <span class="italic">knees</span> to go take
					a tub. After sixty days of climbing up the stairs on my knees I moved my bed
					from downstairs into my living room in Marshfield.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Then I tried to find a live-in nurse to give me my
					drugs so I wouldn’t have to touch them myself because of my past history. I
					called up the Nurses Society at the hospital near me in Marshfield and left a
					number. A woman called back, very excited about doing it. I hung up and went,
					“Oh, god, I <span class="italic">know</span> that name. Who is it?” Susan, who
					was working for me at the time, said, “That’s the fuckin’ stalker girl! <span
						class="italic">Ach!</span> That’s that stalker bitch down the street, who
					drives by and we duck all the time!” And I went, “<span class="italic"
						>Wha-a-a-at?”</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I could hear her in the echoing recesses of my
					addled brain saying in her crazy scary lady voice: “Steven, love, I followed you
					back from Sunapee, I’m going to make you well .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I will never
					abandon you.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">Whoops!</span> So this nurse
					is <span class="italic">another</span> stalker woman off her meds who’s now
						<span class="italic">moved</span>
					<span class="italic">to Boston,</span> moved <span class="italic">near</span>
					me. I got a restraining order, but all she did was to move <span class="italic"
						>farther</span> down the block and become a nurse, a fuckin’ nurse, Oh,
						<span class="italic">nuuuuuuurse!</span> They’re very sweet, nurses, and
					overweight—like in the movie<span class="italic"> Misery</span>. Maybe women who
					satiate themselves with food have a need to take care of everyone else but
					themselves! I told Susan, “Ah! Get rid of that number!!!”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">So, now I was forced to bring my own drugs home.
					And needless to say, I was back in my element. I wasn’t taking the pills, I was
					grinding them up and snorting them. Eyes pinned, mind numbed. I wasn’t the only
					one buying drugs from the dealer on the street. Everybody was doing OxyContin,
					Joe more than me. Oh, sure, we had our reasons, um, excuses. Joe’s knees and my
					fucked-up foot. Ya gotta take something for that severe pain. Unfortunately,
					those were the only things that worked for us.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">For the first month I needed serious
					painkillers—for the second month, I should have started weaning down, and the
					third month, been damn near off the drugs completely. But these are my feet and
					I’m <span class="italic">walking</span> on the surgery so by the end of three
					months, I was hooked but good. I still couldn’t walk and the pain was <span
						class="italic">excruciating</span>. One day one of our road crew came down
					to visit me, and knowing what he did on the road, I asked him if he had any
					you-know-what. I was already taking it so why not do a little more. And I would
					have, had a dear friend not bought it all off him an hour before. Within a month
					I was one of his regulars. I’m glad he did it, but after I came out of Las
					Encinas a lot of my friends began saying, “That motherfucker! He’s fired!” Well,
					I didn’t think he should be around me and I didn’t want him working for the
					band, but I never had any bad feelings about him. Shit, I was in a lot of pain
					and he was trying to make me feel good!</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I couldn’t get enough narcotics to dull the pain in
					my feet. I had whole jars full of Xanax. Not the cute little pills your mother
					gives you, but these monster things—pills so big they got named Zanzibars.
					They’re slammin’, they’re great—I got them from Mexico—I didn’t know about the
					online stuff back then. Xanax, Librium, Valium, etc., commonly known as benzos
					from their basic chemical compound, benzodiazepine. Now, in rehab, if you came
					in really strung out on benzos, some counselors would take you off to one side
					and whisper in your ear, “Go out and get yourself hooked on heroin, instead,
					because the benzos take a year to kick and are so much harder to come down from.
					And heroin only takes two months to get off.” Go figure.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">But the painkillers and tranquilizers weren’t the
					only problem. One day a friend of mine came over and he said, “You wanna do a
					few lines?” I said, “What? You have blow on you now?” I mean, those were the
					words. I leaped at it. I said, “You have it on you now?” He goes, “Yeah, I got
					it.” “Well, could I have some of it?” God, and I was shaking like a leaf. I
					hadn’t done blow in fifteen years.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">This drug binge went on for a month .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
					or two .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or three. Then, at the end of March, John Henry, who owns
					the Red Sox, called me at the house and asked if I would sing for the opening
					game. And it was “Let me see. Okay, yes.” So on April 4, 2007, I went to Fenway
					Park and sang the national anthem. I’m in the midst of singing “The
					Star-Spangled Banner” and I’m high as a kite. The words are melting like candle
					wax against the blue sky.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="sbdropcap">B</span>ut at a
					certain point I said, “This shit’s gotta stop!” So I went to L.A. and got even
					more fucked-up. The ostensible reason for going out there was that during the
					third month after my operation, Guitar Hero was doing a version of their video
					game with Aerosmith. I had to get out there and do stuff, on pain meds <span
						class="italic">and </span>in a cast for my foot. Early in the fourth month
					I’m out of the cast—walking around pretty good wearing a sneaker with the toe
					cut off. I have some pretty impressive insulated socks and a toe condom I wear
					onstage.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I was so into Guitar Hero. I love cartoons, comic
					books. When I was a kid up in New Hampshire at Trow Rico, my comic books were
						<span class="italic">Archie </span>and<span class="italic"> Scrooge
						McDuck—</span>and it was pretty cool stuff<span class="italic">.</span> It
					was sweetly demented, but who knew? Whoever wrote that shit? Scrooge McDuck
					diving in his pool of dimes and nickels, coming up with his lucky dime.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I’ve always wanted to be a comic book character.
					Now I was going to get my chance. A cartoon of <span class="italic">me</span>!
					Tylertoons! “How are you going to make me come alive on Guitar Hero?” I asked.
					“Well, we’ll draw you.” “But you draw me based on what?” “We put you in an
					outfit with balls attached to it and the camera reads those outlines and creates
					a two-dimensional figure.” I had to dig a little to find out that the guy who
					did the characters in all the other Guitar Heroes was going to be doing <span
						class="italic">me</span>. That’s when I went, “Whoa! You mean you’re going
					to have some guy do <span class="italic">my character</span>?” The director took
					me aside and said, “If we had known you wanted to this—” I said, “Didn’t anyone
					tell you I was coming here?” “No, management said they didn’t think you’d want
					to do this.” You might say, well, it’s Guitar Hero, it’s about <span
						class="italic">guitar</span> players, they don’t really care about lead
					singers, but I knew better. Whatever they were going to show was going to be
					called “Aerosmith,” and I’ve been known to be the lead singer from time to time.
					And I thought all the moves that Joe and I had come up with onstage for the last
					forty years that we were known for would have been the perfect thing to take the
					game over the top and represent like no stunt doubles could ever have thought of
					doing. The interactions between us that millions of pople love to see would have
					been priceless for the game. At Activision they thought we’d have been happy to
					have someone other than us do the performance because that’s how they’d always
					done it. It didn’t occur to them that <span class="italic">maybe</span> Steven
					would want to front the band, playing himself, in the video game. Let the bars
					come down on the video screen and there’s Aerosmith. It’s a guitar-driven video
					game with a fret board and everyone’s playing that color-coded toy guitar, but
					people are also going to be looking around at the other members of the band,
					aren’t they—including maybe <span class="italic">the lead
					singer—</span>especially if they happen to be singing along while following the
					guitar leads? I mean when people are playing “Dream On” on the Guitar Hero game,
					do you think anybody can even <span class="italic">hear</span> the guitar part
					through that vocal? <span class="italic">“Every ti-ime that I look
						.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</span> It’s like on “Satisfaction,” there’s a guitar
					playing the opening chords. But do you think anyone can pick out what the rhythm
					guitar’s doing on that song if there even is one?</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">So in the spring of ’08 I went to the Neversoft’s
					motion capture studio to get myself turned into an animated cartoon. For four
					weeks I jumped around in an outfit with tracking balls stuck on it so that I
					could be digitized. They even attached them to my mouth: my upper lip, my lower
					lip, my grin—that alone took an hour. When it was done I pulled the balls off my
					face, put them in a bag, and snuck out with them. I figured if I could get out
					with my balls intact management would never get a chance to break ’em again.
					Managers have a way of being really truly mean.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Aerosmith Guitar Hero turned out so great, what
					could be better—it’s like a cartoon biography of the band—<span class="italic"
						>and</span> you get to be Joe Perry. Although I do know Joe tried it out and
					couldn’t get beyond the first level! Ahh, heck, he’s always playing with himself
					anyway. It’s a sort of biorama as well as a video game. You can catch Aerosmith
					from start to finish—or at least up to 2008. You get to see us at Nipmuc High
					School in Massachusetts, where we played our first gig, Max’s Kansas City in New
					York, where we got signed, the Orpheum Theater in Boston. It’s like watching
					your yearbook on DVD. You see the girl that you took to the prom, and you go,
					“Omigod, look at what <span class="italic">I</span> look like. What’s with the
					hair—and the Prince Valiant haircut?”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">We got into the whole Guitar Hero thing when they
					put “Same Old Song and Dance” on Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock. That sold a
					whole lot of copies and we started thinking, <span class="italic">Hmmmm</span>
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <span class="italic">now, what if the first Guitar Hero built
						entirely around one group—was us!</span> It seemed like a great idea,
					especially since we hadn’t put out a studio album of original material since
					2001, and people were starting to say, “When are you guys gonna put some more
					shit out there?”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I’m only bummed that it wasn’t Lead Singer Hero—but
					they’ll get around to it. Ya think? I think that the <span class="italic"
						>face</span> of a song is whatever the lyrics are, wouldn’t you agree with
					that? You know what’s going to happen? In about three years they’re going to
					come out with a video game featuring the Stones or some other group with a great
					lead singer, and when that happens they’ll have someone miming the singer and
					you’ll get a microphone with the game and sing along with it like karaoke.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Having been clean and sober for so many years it
					was a crying shame the state I was in after I got my feet fixed. I was bumping
					into people, doing crazy stuff. “Man, you were fallin’ asleep last night right
					in the middle of dinner,” people were telling me, and I was saying, “You saw me
					do <span class="italic">what</span>?” I was just, “Oh, Jesus, this is fucked-up,
					I wanna live.” But ya know how my girl Amy sings it .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Hence the drug addiction rumors in the press once
					again. I didn’t respond. I was full-on with the OxyContin and the Xanax. I was
					crushing the long fat two-milligram Zanzibars and inhaling them.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I went to the annual MAP Fun Benefit Concert
					honoring Alice Cooper and Slash. I presented Slash with the From the Heart Award
					for his support of MAP’s program: access to addiction treatment regardless of
					your financial situation. Slash had been clean and sober for three years and
					here was I still high. <span class="italic">Aaach!</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I was high on drugs during that 2007 tour, so high
					on Xanax I let little things really get me over the top. Oh, god! I thought,
						<span class="italic">Here I am again in that place again, being a fucking
						drug addict.</span> I began to panic. <span class="italic">Am I going to go
						out like this?</span> I’m thinking to myself, <span class="italic">Am I
						gonna go out like this?</span> I have this running thing with the band about
					death, the deadline.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I went off the deep end out in L.A. After a while
					of being absolutely insane, I decided to get off everything, but I wanted to do
					it by myself—never a good idea. My plan was to get myself a suite in a hotel and
					have a doctor—using other meds than the ones I was taking—wean me off my drugs
					of choice.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I happened to know Justin Murdoch, whose dad owned
					the Westlake Four Seasons—he’s the other Murdoch, David Murdoch. He owns Dole,
					and he’s the largest landowner on the island of Lanai in Hawaii, my favorite
					place on earth. I’d met Justin a few years earlier at Koi, a restaurant in L.A.
					Outside the eatery was a car, a Shelby Cobra, no paint on it, just the body, and
					I went, “Aha! This is interesting, I wonder who that belongs to.” I walked in,
					it was, like, after hours, not many people there, and I asked, “Who’s fuckin’
					car is that?” This guy stood up and it was Justin Murdoch. We’ve been best
					friends ever since. Justin’s got more money than God. He flew me over to Lanai
					in his father’s plane while I had hep C and introduced me to the doctor who
					invented a cure for addiction.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">So Justin got me a room at the family hotel, the
					Westlake Four Seasons—with an adjoining small room where the nurses would sleep.
					The idea was that my doctor would come see me every day and I would detox there.
					The doc and the nurses are coming in at night, I’m doing my meds while I’m
					sleeping. It was a good setup just with the drug he was giving me for my feet at
					home, Subutex, an alternative to heroin. It’s a drug that fools the nervous
					system. It’s a narcotic, different from heroin—almost as hard to get off. A
					month and a half and a <span class="italic">hundred and forty</span>
					<span class="italic">thousand dollars</span> later, I’m out of there. I was off
					the narcotics for a time, still doing an occasional OxyContin, you know, four
					times eighty milligrams a day, and still doing Subutex.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">While the doc was detoxing me, three weeks in—I
					went, “Stop! Doc, will you come to Boston with me because Joe is at home and
					just had a knee replacement and I know he could use a tweak. We gotta help him.”
					I got on the plane with Erin and my doctor and we all flew to Boston first
					class. Doc stayed at my house, and the next day I called up my brother Joe and
					for a moment he was into it, too. “All right, come over,” he said. The doctor
					went over and told him, “If you want to get out of this cycle of dependency I
					can help you. Come to L.A., and I’ll do for you what I’ve done for Steven.” Next
					day I jumped back on the plane with the doc, went back to L.A., was in the same
					hotel, started the regimen again, and after that I don’t exactly know what
					happened. But I didn’t hear from Joe again for months. A week later I fired
						<span class="italic">that</span> doctor because I was still as strung out as
					I was when I went it. I was singing Amy’s song before she wrote it. But I began
					to seriously think about rehab.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Erin had left me the month before, went off with
					her girlfriend, started going to some meetings, and then checked into the rehab
					at Aurora Las Encinas Hospital in Pasadena. Unlike most rehabs it’s on a huge
					estate, twenty-six acres. It was started in 1901 to treat alcoholic movie stars.
					The doctors were so rich and the place so prosperous back then that they were
					able to landscape it in the most picturesque style. They planted exotic and
					indigenous trees on the grounds. Trees from Africa, India, South America. It was
					like an arboretum. A lot of the Hollywood stars of the twenties, thirties, and
					forties would go there to dry out—that was before they knew that alcohol was a
					disease—and to get them off the booze, they’d give them <span class="italic"
						>morphine</span>. While I was there I slept in the house W. C. Fields died
					in. Slept like a baby.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I went to visit Erin in Las Encinas. I was going to
					take her to the movies, but she didn’t want to go. I was sitting in her little
					cabin at the outpatient clinic chatting with her and looking around and saying,
					“This is pretty nice! Hey, what’s up here?” And at that point her therapist came
					in, took one look at me, and said, “Steven, maybe you need to stay here
					tonight.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">And I went, “Oh, god! Are you going to try and talk
					me into going through rehab?”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“Yes, Steven, I think that would be a good
					idea.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I went into the bathroom, took my bottle of pills
					out, and dumped it in the bottom of her wastebasket, came out, and, given my
					impetuous Italian sensibility, I said, “That’s it! I’m in.” Because I knew that
					I couldn’t do it on my own, and they had an intensive detox program. So I went
					for the real rumpy-pumpy, baby.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">A week and a half later: <span class="italic"
						>Ahhhh!</span> I was in there and God had put this guy named Joe (<span
						class="italic">Yo</span> in Spanish) in with me. He was from Mexico, right
					across the border. I thought <span class="italic">I</span> was in bad shape! I’d
					been doing, like, four Zanzibars a day, two Zanzibars during the night. I’d wake
					up every two hours, snort a half, go back to sleep, and sleep forever. This guy
					is lying on his back screaming <span class="italic">at the top of his
						lungs,</span> holding the backs of his legs, kicking up in the air, going,
						<span class="italic">“Ahhhh! Ahhhh! Ahhhh!”</span> Sc-<span class="italic"
						>rea</span>-ming. They’re shooting him up with shit, but <span
						class="italic">nothing</span> worked. He finally settled down after two
					weeks and when he was in good enough shape to talk I got to hear his story. He’d
					been eating six eighty-milligram OxyContins a day for ten years.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I always wondered what I was gonna be like at
					fifty, and here I was sixty and fucked-up. Give me a fucking break! It was all
					going too fucking fast! Although time never slows down as much as it does in
					rehab. Going through detox you look up at the clock and say, “Fuck, it’s only
						<span class="italic">one o’clock</span>? Oh, god, it’s going to be a <span
						class="italic">long </span>fucking day!” And they get you up at six! When
					you’re in there detoxing at sixty it’s <span class="italic">very</span>
					humbling. You tell people, and they go, “<span class="italic">What?!</span>
					Muchacho, you don’t <span class="italic">look</span> sixty!” Or they say, “You
					telling me, my brother, that you <span class="italic">bought</span> that shit,
					you eat <span class="italic">shit</span>!”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">But, you try to protest, these were <span
						class="italic">prescription</span> drugs, man! Of course, that’s just the
					problem. Prescription drugs are the new plague. There’s career drug addicts like
					me—and just about every other person in America who’s on some kind of meds. Half
					of the people reading this book are going to be on pharmaceuticals, on legal
					meds. It’s a pharmaceutical world, baby. “Take when feeling anxious, when you
					can’t sleep—or just whenever you want to experience that mellow Swannee River
					mood,” reads the tiny Courier type on the label. Why would I go out and get
					drugs from a dirty low-down dealer when I can just go and get a script from my
					sweet old family doctor. “Uh, Doc, do you have anything that’ll, you know,
					attack the higher centers of pain because, see, I really need something that’ll
					get me through the night, through my divorce, I’ve just been laid off and I need
					to get rid of this pain in here. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” That’s why all my friends are
					cops, or dead.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Have you looked in any of your friends’ medicine
					cabinets lately? You don’t have to go down to Avenue Z and score, no, you can
					get your drugs from your doctor and hide them from everyone. But trust one who
					knows from bitter experience, it will start to dawn on you, maybe not until
					you’re forty or fifty, that you’re hooked. Sooner or later the benzo fiends will
					come and bite you on the ass, your little sleep aids will turn on you. You began
					taking half an Ambien to go to sleep and now you’re up to <span class="italic"
						>six</span> a night? But those prescription drugs just won’t come through
					for you.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Wait a minute, what am I saying? Am I going to turn
					people off ? Are they going to say, “I’m not reading this damn book! This
					sonofabitch is preachin’ to me and I just got myself a big bottle of benzos.”
					Well, actually, you already bought the book, right, so what the hell?</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">And that’s how I got into all this shit in the
					first place: helpful doctors and accommodating dealers all trafficking in the
					same Mephistophelian meds. I just couldn’t stand going through twelve years of
					pain and suffering and not being able to sleep at night! Not my sleep, doctor,
					not sleep <span class="italic">that knits up the raveled sleeve of care,</span>
					for god’s sake!</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Erin was at Las Encinas, halfway through her rehab.
					When you get through detox you go into residential units—just a hundred feet
					away. Nice cabins. There was a tree growing over my cabin roof. I would hear
					this <span class="italic">plick-plick </span>sound above my head. Hard little
					shell-shaped purple flowers falling on the roof. I put a sleeping bag on the
					bench outside my cabin and brought my pillows—and purple flowers rained down on
					my head. In the morning the ground was covered with purple flowers. I sang
					“Purple Rain” every day!</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Erin and I had been <span class="italic">flying
					</span>on this stuff for two years, Xanax being our drug of choice. I didn’t
					like the me that was me on benzos, and coming out of that din was a revelation.
					It was now you’re here, front and center, present. It was easier for me to do
					because I’d had practice. I’d come out of the din four times before this.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">But after a few days I went, “Oh, my god, what
						<span class="italic">is</span> this?” You’re in there for benzo addiction,
					and at the clinic they start telling you, “It takes months to get off that
					stuff.” I said, “Oh, yeah? That’s bullshit!” to that, as I do to everything. One
					of the things I hated (you’re in there with this Dr. Blum—Barry Blum, head of
					the Chemical Dependency Program, along with Dr. Drew Pinsky) is the forced damn
					cheeriness—“Good morning, Steven! How are we today?” “Hey, Dr. Blum, I’m feeling
					just <span class="italic">great </span>!” You see him every day and he has to be
					sure you really are cheery—but not <span class="italic">too</span> cheery (that
					would be suspicious) and not slipping into despair, depression, and suicidal
					gloom. So, because of the tendency toward morbid depression and desperation, Dr.
					Blum would see each patient every day—the more critical would be visited by one
					of the staff every fifteen minutes—because everyone’s detoxing, hitting walls. I
					couldn’t sleep for the first four days: “No one’s gonna die from no sleep,” he
					tells me. “But maybe we should up your Seroquel.” So they gave you Seroquel and
					Neurontin to sleep. By the time you’ve finished this book you’ll all have
					degrees in psychopharmacology.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Seroquel is a nonnarcotic, antipsychotic med for
					people who are coming off stuff, especially benzos. They gave me a patch of
					Clonidine to lower my blood pressure. Clonidine is used to treat hypertension
					(high blood pressure), alcohol abuse, nicotine withdrawal, and dependency on
					benzos. “Nah,” I said, “I’m not takin’ them. I’ve been through that and I’m not
					going to start banging into walls and doors again like a rag doll.” “Well,
					Steven, we’re here to help you. Why don’t you just try one.” Look, I can be
					reasonable, so I said, “All right, I’ll do <span class="italic">one</span>.” And
					this time it was bearable. But in the other rehabs I was in, they had me on
						<span class="italic">four</span> patches or a bunch of pills. I was the
					living dead. I was grunting like a stoat, making ungodly noises: <span
						class="italic">mrrr-vrreeeeeee</span>. I couldn’t wake up, I couldn’t sleep
					or get up. I had no muscle control.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I’d been on this stuff before at Chit Chat, that
					rehab in Wernersville, Pennsylvania. I got sober there the third and last time
					in rehab—or so I thought. Now we’re up to four rehabs: Hazelden to East House to
					Chit Chat to Las Encinas. I’ve been in so many rehabs they’re like my alma
					maters. My foot has been in rehab, for chrissake. In 2001 I got a wing of the
					Roxbury rehab clinic in Boston named for me. I did a “Got Milk?” ad—which was
					pretty funny given my reputation. I would even have done one for a rehab if
					they’d asked me—they could have used “The Farm”.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
				<p class="x1song-first" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">There’s a cockroach in
						my coffee</span></p>
				<p class="x1song-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">There’s a needle in my
						arm</span></p>
				<p class="x1song-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">And I feel like New York
						Cittay</span></p>
				<p class="x1song-last" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">Get me to the
						farm</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Whatever it takes—like I said, I’m just such a good
					drug addict. But this time I knew, because I’d been through it so many times
					before, that it was now or never. I was sixty, and if I didn’t stop now, when
					was I going to do it? Stop everything, including the Xanax, and Xanax was the
					killer. By comparison it was pretty easy getting off the narcotics. I couldn’t
					sleep at night—the anxiety I felt coming off Xanax was extreme. A benzo
					nightmare. Benzodiazepine, <span class="italic">ach!</span> But to be honest,
					benzos were the shit and I loved them. It’s just that I can’t be anywhere near
					them. I know I’m a drug addict. “Hi, my name is Steven and I’m an alcoholic,
					drug addict, coke freak, and benzo demon.” It’s insidious stuff. Benzo is
					Beelzebub’s latest brew and I’ll tell you why. You, even you, reasonable reader,
					I will tell you what you do without even knowing it: you open your bottle of
					Xanax or Valium or Librium, you take out mother’s little helper and slip it
					under your tongue and wait for that feeling to hit. You know just what that buzz
					is going to be when it stings your central nervous system like a pharmaceutical
					viper.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">And you’ll say to me, “No, not really, Steven. I
					only take it to go to sleep or when I have a panic attack.” Uh-huhn. But I <span
						class="italic">know</span>. When people take those drugs, even nonaddicts,
					they wait for that mood-altering brain fog to kick in. They go, “Yeah, I love it
					when it hits, I get that warm, woozy feeling, and that’s when I know I can go to
					sleep.” And I <span class="italic">cry</span> when I hear that, real chemical
						tears—<span class="italic">a-heh-heh-heh-he-oooooh,
					ah-ha-ha-haaaaa—</span>because I love that, too. I just can’t do it!</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">One day I’m at Las Encinas on my way to the
					lunchroom. I’m stumbling around banging into things because they put me on
					Seroquel, and to get to the lunchroom you had to go through the bipolar clinic.
					That was really fun. As I pass through, a heavyset guy looks up at me and
					smiles. I see his teeth are all sharpened like Dracula. Remember that? That was
					a bit of insanity that was all the rage right before shaving your head became a
					craze. I said, “Hey, how ya doing?” And he goes, “Oh, real good. I love your
					music!” It was all very relaxed, as relaxed as it could be with people going
					through serious mood swings. I was glad it was all so casual and informal.
					Weren’t we all on the same ship of fools, all suffering, deluded creatures, all
					the same under the eyes of God and Dr. Drew Pinsky? But I forgot that I was
					still in the United States of Amnesia, where everything up to and including
					mental illness is subject to the overriding law of sensationalism, gossip, and
					innuendo. Paris Hilton: New Sex Tape! Nick Nolte’s Cocaine and Booze DUI!

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">As I’m walking through, trying not to stare too
					much, I see a guy playing a guitar. “Woo, give me that,” I say. I don’t really
					play guitar, but I watch my fingers and I’m strumming away, and suddenly there’s
					a huge crowd of people around me and everyone’s got their cell phones out,
					taking photos, recording. I looked up and went, “<span class="italic"
						>Aiiiieeeee!</span> Fuck! You know, I’m not supposed to be in here!” Word
					got out that I was in Las Encinas and I heard the tabloids were offering a
					considerable amount of money for a picture of me in there looking as fucked-up
					as possible. So after that, they put police out front—not to prevent homicidal
					psychopaths from breaking in and attacking their old shrinks, but to stop the
					paparazzi from sneaking in to catch me drooling on the floor.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">When you won’t answer their dopey questions—“Give
					us a full accounting of why you’re in there and what it feels like to be back in
					rehab for the <span class="italic">fourth</span> time”—they’ll go ahead and
					write what they want anyway. They did that with my divorce, Aerosmith breaking
					up, and Erin punching out the girl in the bar in New Orleans.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I called Slash up from rehab and said, “Slash, I
					got somethin’ to tell you, man.” He goes, “So do I!” I go, “No, no, me first.”
					He says, “What? What?” He thought I was going to say, “I’m trashed and I’m here
					with my friend, I’m in—” but instead I said, “Slash, know where I am?” And he
					said, “Oh, I <span class="italic">know</span> where you are.” “You sonofabitch,”
					I said, “what do you mean?” And he goes, “Well, you know Steve’s in there with
					you.” I said, “Excuse me?” He said, “Yeah, Steven Adler’s right there in Las
					Encinas. He’s back in detox.” “<span class="italic">What?</span> Steven fucking
					Adler’s in detox again?” Steven Adler, the original drummer from Guns ’N’ Roses
					was in there with me at the same rehab and I didn’t know it.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">The poor guy. Talk about an appetite for
					destruction! He got fired from Guns ’N’ Roses in 1990 for being too fucked-up to
					play drums, ODed on smack in his car in 1995, a year later had a stroke and went
					into a coma after doing a speedball (cocaine and heroin), and after a second
					stroke ended up with a speech impediment.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Slash asked me to go over and say hi to him. Detox
					was right down the hill from my cabin so I walked down. Steven was a total
					wreck. He was slurring his words so badly I could barely understand him. “Uh
					hiyaaah, Steeeveeeen, aaahm noot stoooned right nooow, I juss taaalk liiike
					thiiis. I’ve haaaaaad twwwwwo sssssssstroooooookes, heeee, huhhh.” I was
					stunned. “You sound good, man,” I said. “Nice goin’!” And I walked out. I wanted
					to throw up. He’s had two strokes, slurs his speech, and he’s a mess. And
					because he’s like that, he’s never going to come back, and he’ll just never not
					be on drugs, and he’ll never be in the band again. So there’s part of his brain
					that knows that and goes, “Fuck it! I’m gonna go get high right now!” And I get
					that. I actually get it. I hope I’m wrong.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Two weeks later I found out that the reason he was
					there was to do <span class="italic">Celebrity Rehab,</span> a reality show on
					VH1 hosted by Dr. Pinsky about famous people in recovery. They don’t film it
					there at Encinas, they do it in a hotel. They wait until the celebrity gets
					detoxed and then get him to reenact his former fucked-upness—which is pretty
					fucked-up, actually. Later on I heard some assistants from the show prepping
					Steven Adler for the <span class="italic">Celebrity Rehab</span> episode.
					“Here’s what I want you to do,” they were telling him. “Tomorrow night, just as
					soon as the sun goes down, we’re going to put you in an ambulance, we’re gonna
					take you over to the hotel. When you get there, fall out onto the ground and go,
					‘Oh, my god! Where am I?’ ” They wanted him to act out his own messed-up state
					when he entered rehab. It was ghoulish and unreal. They gave him thirty grand
					for the episode, he snorted it all, crashed his car, and he ended up in jail
					detox.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">It didn’t seem to me all that ethical using actual
					fucked-up patients like Steven Adler in a reality show, but who am I to say? Not
					to mention getting trashed celebrities to mime their own self-destructive
					nosedives, which they then sensationalize on a melo-fucking-dramatic reality
					show, which so traumatizes them they end up in worse shape than ever—from the
					drugs they bought with the money from the show. <span class="italic">Oh</span>
					<span class="italic">nurr-se!</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Well, here’s how Dr. Drew does it: he gets people
					in and then he has an announcer explain in a smarmy, therapeutic voice what the
					patient’s paradigm is, his traits, his innermost feelings, how it was, how it is
					now, and how it could be in the future with positive affirmations spread over
					the top like butter on new bread. That’s how they get away with it. All
					delivered under a veneer of sanctimonious concern. Like the corrupt state
					senator who goes on the air with that stone-casting voice, “Yes, I was there,
					she was a prostitute .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. regrettable incident.” With no response
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. just that flinty smile. John Lennon read that type brilliantly
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
				<p class="x1song-first" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">There’s room at the
						top they are telling you still,</span></p>
				<p class="x1song-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">But first you must learn
						how to smile as you kill,</span></p>
				<p class="x1song-last" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">If you want to be like
						the folks on the hill</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Every Saturday morning, there was a “What’s Up,
					Doc?” session with Dr. Barry Blum, where significant others and family groups
					could come and talk and ask questions. Then on Saturday afternoon Dr. Drew would
					give a talk, and the room was packed. If everyone had inhaled at the same time
					the windows would have imploded, there were that many people. His talks were so
					interesting because he would expostulate about his theories. He had some curious
					poses and stances, which he delivered as psychopharmacological dogma. Such as
					that addicts have especially sympathetic receptor sites for narcotics—we all do,
					actually—and that’s why they’re drug addicts. Drug addicts, in other words, have
					the drug-addict gene. Well, if I have that gene, what did the conquistadors
					have, the El Dorado gene? And what about Magellan, did he have a
					global-navigation gene? “Flat? Did you say the world was flat? Get in the boats!
					We’re goin’!” Anybody that’s got any balls at all, are they the ones with the
					gene or without? Dr. Pinsky would claim that there’s a certain paradigm to our
					behavioral traits, but his argument is bullshit: “Well, I get why he would try
					drugs; he’s predisposed to them.” Which, of course, makes me wonder why <span
						class="italic">wouldn’t</span> this hypothetical person take drugs out of
					curiosity to see what they’re like? Are there genes for people who go up to the
					wall? Or do other people have a gene that suppresses adventure, risk, and
					curiosity? Shrinks don’t even go there!</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">It’s interesting that Dr. Pinsky never came up to
					me, never made any advances; he certainly didn’t ask me to be on his celebrity
					rehab, because—at best—I would have gone, “Are you <span class="italic"
						>fucking</span> kidding me?”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I come out of any detox a wreck, but benzo detox is
					the worst. After five weeks, your skin is crawling, because they stifle your
					nerves. People take Xanax and other benzos because they’re having a <span
						class="italic">nerrrr-vous breakd-d-down. </span>It’s a great drug for
					masking. In a really laid-back, jive-talking voice you’ll tell yourself, “Hey,
					I’m really comfortable now, so what the fuck are you tellin’ me, dude, lay the
					shit on me, because I don’t hear you. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">When you’re coming out of that benzo din you get to
					see what life has to offer again. Oh, that’s what mango smells like, that’s the
					color of a peony. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I’m ecstatic to be sober again now and coming
					up a wormhole. I’m ready to change the channel.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">The more spiritual side of me tends to get lost
					behind the stereotype of the Sex Addict, the Toxic Twin, the Screamin’ Demon,
					the Terror of the Tropicana. But if you listen to “Dream On,” a song I wrote in
					1969, you might see me in a different light&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
				<p class="x1song-first" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">Half my life’s in

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I went to church, I had a sister, I’m Italian, and
					I’ve probably seen the sun set and rise as many times as anyone. I liked cutting
					the umbilical cord at my son Taj’s birth. I liked smelling the placenta. I like
					the act of making love rather than saying, “I fucked you!” If anybody wants to
					see the spiritual side of Steven Tyler, well, it’s fucking there!</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Erin got out of rehab two weeks before me—she’d
					started earlier than I had—but the day I got out, my new life started unfolding
						<span class="italic">that</span> day, while I was making <span
						class="italic">wild</span> love to Erin, talking about how we were so <span
						class="italic">fragile</span> coming from the rehab, like coming out of the
					womb, with all these feelings of newness and astonishment. Feeling the wind
					blow, the sun on your face. When you’re high, you’re numb to everything. We had
					been taking so much OxyContin and Xanax for so long our feelings were deadened.
					When you reemerge, everything affects you wildly. The mildest cool breeze and
					you’re freezing, you’re so vulnerable. Somebody says something negative, the
					slightest thing, and you’re devastated. We came out of that cocoon, and even two
					months later, we were still reclaiming ourselves, recovering from the din of
					addiction.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Colors! I’m so into colors now. I want to eat <span
						class="italic">food</span> that’s different colors. I can feel the wind
					blowing against my face and hear the woods, the woods that were <span
						class="italic">mine </span>when I was a kid.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Back in Sunapee, I took off my shoes and felt the
					cool green moss on my feet; I smelled the pine needles, the pungent, earthy odor
					of decaying leaves. For a moment I stood alone in a clearing, listening to that
					muffled silence.</p>
