				<p class="x1bm-first" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t’s the fall of
					1979—just after the Fall of Aerosmith Mach&nbsp;1, the departure of Joe fucking
					Perry. I’m ready to time travel with my carry-on bag of goodies. Into the great
					unknown, baby. Yep, we’re gonna get under the hood. I’m going to tell you the
					way it was: unexpurgated—that means nothing censored, nothing gained!</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Aeromythology was built on the glamour of
					self-destruction. Self-destruction was <span class="italic">great</span>
					<span class="italic">fun</span>—still, I wouldn’t want to do it again. Like the
					old joke about the Viking: “Fuck, not another night of rape and pillage, mate!”
					Of course, in rock ’n’ roll we don’t classify debauchery as bad behavior—that
					comes with the territory. Bad, shameful behavior would be turning up for shows
					in no fit state to play .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and there was plenty of that, too. Don’t
					worry, with this band there was at least another ten years of wretched excess,
					drug abuse, and hell-bent self-destruction to come.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Every once in a while, I’ll hit on something useful
					to tell you, especially if I’m talking about a subject that I’m kind of an
					expert on, like roasting marshmallows. How long the stick should be and how long
					to leave it in the fire. See, I come from a long line of fact-based, overbearing
					people.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="sbdropcap">I</span> was
					living with Cyrinda in that gray house up in Sunapee, had my Porsche and the
					Jeep. Mia was a brand-new baby. Scoring drugs had become our principal activity.
					Cyrinda, my friend Rick, and I would all drive down to Marshfield outside of
					Boston to get dope. Joe Perry had thrown me onto this dealer before he split the
					band. Back then in ’79, ’80, two blocks from Joe’s house lived this guy named
					John we got all our dope from. A three-hour drive! I now live in Marshfield, I
					moved there in ’88. When I go home I get off at the same exit—Exit 12—the same
					one I used to take when I was scoring dope. Ironic or just moronic?</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Alas, I had kicked Joe out of the band in the
					middle of <span class="italic">Night in the Ruts,</span> our new album due out
					fall 1979, and Leber-Krebs were putting pressure on me to finish it. Joe played
					on “No Surprize,” “Chiquita,” “Cheesecake,” “Three Mile Smile,” and “Bone to
					Bone (Coney Island Whitefish Boy)”—the song I wrote about Joe. A Coney Island
					whitefish is a rubber. Brad Whitford, Neil Thompson, Jimmy Crespo, and Richie
					Supa handled guitars on the remaining tracks.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Even before we started I knew what I wanted the
					title to be: <span class="italic">Night in the Ruts.</span> I was into switching
					the initial letters of names and words, like Johnny Ringo into Ronny Jingo, so
						<span class="italic">Night in the Ruts</span> is code for<span
						class="italic"> Right in the Nuts. </span>Back then you couldn’t have an
					album title like that, the censors were all over you. You’d get blipped no
					matter what .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you couldn’t even sing “Goddammit!” For the cover
					I’d thought of filling a room with nuts. Twenty or thirty big burlap bags of
					nuts would cost you, what, eighteen dollars a bag? We’d be standing there up to
					our waists in nuts. And nobody could argue about the title because we <span
						class="italic">were</span> nuts. It was a takeoff on the cover of <span
						class="italic">The Who Sell Out, </span>where Roger Daltrey is sitting in a
					bathtub filled with beans and a surprised look on his face. I ran into Roger
					later on and asked him, “Were you really sitting in a tub full of beans? What
					was it like in there? Was it really full to the top or—?” “Nah, they, like,
					filled it with cloth,” he said, “and then the beans on top. I didn’t have to sit
					in all that.” Damn.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">But in the end we shot the cover in the entrance to
					a coal mine. It was black with coal dust. I rolled in it for a couple of
					minutes. And then I went over and rubbed the coal dust on everyone’s face. It
					was a dark and gloomy cover, but we were in a bleak and doomy state.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Writing songs had gotten harder and harder, and now
					I had to write them without Joe. Joe’s riffs were the engine .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and
					the engine had stalled. I had tried writing with a bunch of different people. In
					the spring of ’78 I flew up to Sunapee with Bobby Womack (who’d written “It’s
					All Over Now”) to work on songs, but nothing came of it. Just a lot of blow and
					blowing lines.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Sometime in the midseventies, David Krebs had
					introduced me to Richie Supa. He was a singer-songwriter signed to Columbia,
					also managed by Leber-Krebs. I was coming out of a meeting one day and he was
					going in and Krebs said, “You guys should hook up! Richie’s a great songwriter,
					blah-blah-blah-blah-blah.” We started talking and one thing led to another, as
					it always does. Richie told me he had a studio at his house and all kinds of
					instruments, so naturally I had to go over and check it out. I think David gave
					me a copy of some of his songs, and I thought, “Yeah, this shit ain’t bad!” When
					I was in L.A. I dropped in on Richie’s session and sang harmony on a song called
					“Chip Away the Stone,” which wound up going on the Cal Jam album.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Richie also wrote “Lightning Strikes,” our first
					MTV video. Then later on there was “Amazing” and “Pink.” He was my ally when
					shit would jump off in the band and I was fighting with Joe Perry. I always had
					Richie to collaborate with. After the band broke up in July ’78, he came up to
					Sunapee that fall and helped me with lyrics. He was also my sounding board and
					played some guitar tracks on the album.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Richie Supa had been in the Rich Kids. He came out
					with me on my first tour without Joe, along with Joey, Tom, and Brad—just before
					Jimmy Crespo came in. Richie played guitar and keyboards because he knew the
					material so well. Given all the drugs on the road, it was incredibly insane.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“No Surprize,” the opening track on <span
						class="italic">Night in the Ruts,</span> was a miniautobiography of the band
					inspired by the night we were signed by Columbia that I rambled on about
					earlier. A brief encore .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">There was a little room onstage behind the amps,
					behind the curtains, off limits to crew, where no one except the band was
					allowed. That was where drugs were laid out on the table so that we could step
					behind the curtain during the show and get a snort of cocaine or heroin
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. whatever flavor of ice cream we wanted.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">We’d run out of blow a lot and we’d be <span
						class="italic">writhing</span>! What a great fucking word, <span
						class="italic">w-r-i-t-h-i-n-g.</span> A snakelike word, sounds like what it
					is. Like the word <span class="italic">sheath.</span> Sheath your weapon! Ooh,
					it’s sexy! <span class="italic">Sheeeaaaaaa-th</span>! It’s a delicious word,
					it’s like eating a grape and eating a cherry, a nice hard one, just ripe, and
					making sure you bite down just enough to break through the skin, but not to hurt
					your teeth on the pit inside.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Drugs were just part of being in rock ’n’ roll
					then. Nobody knew the downside of years and years of cocaine abuse and we could
					care less. It was the thing to do. Everybody laying it out for you, even the
					cops.</p>
				<p class="x1song-first" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">Oh the backstage is
						rockin’ and we’re coppin’ from the local police</span></p>
				<p class="x1song-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">That’s right the local
						police</span></p>
				<p class="x1song-last" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">Or the justice of
						peace</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Promoters would have it backstage. There would be a
					deli platter and a mound of coke. So even if you didn’t want to get high that
					night, even if your nose was falling off because it was raw and bloody from all
					the snorting, you ran into it at the next gig. <span class="italic"
						>Boo-hoo!</span> That was just the climate. I never flew without having some
					blow on me.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">By the end of the seventies, some nights I was so
					out of it our road manager, Joe Baptista, would have to carry me onstage. The
					promoter would be sitting there in the dressing room with a look of horror on
					his face. I’m almost comatose, he’s hyperventilating. He thinks he’s presenting
					the legendary cash cow Aerosmith, and now he’s going to lose his shirt because
					the lead singer’s down for the count. Is he dead or alive? What am I going to
					do? “You’d better get him on that stage. I don’t know how he’s going to do this
					show, but we’ve got too many kids out there.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Not to worry. The minute my feet hit the stage, I’m
					off and running. I don’t know how it happens, but hey, you get up there in front
					of twenty thousand people and it’s a high in itself, it’s a charged space.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Still, the train kept a-rollin’ and we kept getting
					high until one night in late ’78, I don’t know where we were, maybe in
					Springfield, Illinois, I blacked out in the middle of “Reefer Headed Woman.”</p>
				<p class="x1song-first" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">I got a reefer headed
						woman</span></p>
				<p class="x1song-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">She fell right down from
						the sky</span></p>
				<p class="x1song-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">Well, I gots to drink me
						two fifths of whiskey</span></p>
				<p class="x1song-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">Just to get half as
						high</span></p>
				<p class="x1song-last" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">When the—</span></p>
				<p class="ibm-fl" xml:lang="en-us">and then I hit the stage like a fish out of
					water.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I rarely went that far, but the few times I did, it
					was due to a little matter of not having the right combination of rocket fuel
					and booze. You drink something and you go onstage on an empty stomach and
					because you’re jumping around and sweating and the lights are hot, you get
					fucked-up fast. When you’re sitting there, it usually takes twelve, fifteen
					minutes for a skin pop in your ass to get in your system. But a runner doing a
					marathon, because he’s inhaling and exhaling so hard, <span class="italic"
						>ah-huh-uh-huh-uh-huh-uh-huh,</span> and his blood pressure’s rising
					rapidly, he’ll get off probably in three minutes flat after you stick a needle
					in his ass because his metabolism is racing.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">What happened is this. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I was up in
					Portland, Maine, got drunk. This was around Christmas 1980 and I was waiting for
					Bebe to come. She was living up there and it was very emotional seeing her
					again. She’d gotten pregnant in Germany and we’d somehow broken up after the
					tour. I guess I was in denial about it being my child, and she’d had just about
					enough of me and decided Todd Rundgren would be a better father. Bebe showed me
					pictures of baby Liv and we both cried before I went on. And, like all nights, I
					would order <span class="italic">two</span> double Beefeater martinis. I would
					down them in five, and chew up the olive really quick as I could, swallow it and
					not throw up. That is kind of where I was at in January 1980. I would drink two
					of those and if I had enough blow, I’d be good onstage, but on this particular
					night I didn’t have <span class="italic">any</span> blow. Happened twice in my
					career that I was so soused and so dizzy that I became a fall-down drunk. Well,
					rather than fall down drunk in front of the audience and act like a pathetic
					idiot for an hour while they throw apples at me, I said, “Fuck this! Please,
					let’s fold the show, man, and get me offstage!” But I knew they’d never stop the
					show just because I was drunk, so I lay down and didn’t move, as if I’d fainted.
					And to make it look convincing I twitched my foot spastically so they’d look at
					the twitch and go, “Look, he’s twitching! Holy shit! He’s having a seizure!”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I really did it good, and Joe Baptista dragged me
					offstage. Now, on my children’s life, this is the truth of what happened. The
					band all said, “He fainted and we took him offstage.” The official account. But
					don’t mind me just because it <span class="italic">happened</span> to me. I
					recovered in the dressing room, slept it off at Tom Hamilton’s house, and the
					tour got postponed for a week.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="sbdropcap">A</span>fter Joe
					left he formed the Joe Perry Project. Brad played with us for a while, then he,
					too, took off in ’82 to form Bradford St. Holmes with Derek St. Holmes, Ted
					Nugent’s ex-vocalist. Fuckin’ great! If you were to ask Brad, he’d probably tell
					you he had to leave, he couldn’t take it. He’ll tell you he had to wheel me out
					and prop me up and hope something would happen.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-art-below" xml:lang="en-us">I replaced Joe with Jimmy Crespo because
					he looked just like Joe, and played really good, too. Nice long hair, skinny
					fucking guy, I thought, hey, bingo! What do I need fucking Joe Perry for? But
					then, think again.</p>

				<p class="captions" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="caption-drop-cap">T</span>he other
					Aerosmith in the 1980s: Tom Hamilton, Barry Gibb Kramer, me, Rick Dufay, and
					Jimmy Crespo. (Aerosmith)</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Our producer, Jack Douglas, found Rick Dufay to
					fill in Brad’s spot. Rick was a big tall guy, long hair, great character but a
					little out of his mind. I asked him, “How did you get in the business? What did
					you do?” and he said, “Well, once I got out of the loony bin. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”
					Turns out the windows had that metal lattice over it, so he took his shirt and
					kept sticking it in the keyhole of the lock on the window and turning it and it
					finally just opened the window and he jumped three stories down, broke both his
					legs. That kind of stuff.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">He’d walk into the Leber-Krebs office and say,
					“Come on, hit me real hard!” He’d lie down on the floor and say, “Come on, give
					me a boot right in the face!” And I’d say, “Get outta here, Rick! What the fuck
					are you doing?” He would want you to beat him up. Jack Douglas would smack him.
					Rick used to wrestle with me, and one day he knocked me down and to this day my
					elbow is still puffed up. He knocked me down and I landed on the floor of my
					apartment and I said, “Fuck, get the fuck out of here!” And that was it. Within
					a year or so he was gone.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="sbdropcap">I</span> was
					stoned for about a year after that and not doing too much, just being a stoned,
					out-of-it guy, living in New York in my drugalogue. I got deeper and deeper into
					drugs, and conveniently Richie Supa had amazing drug connections—always useful.
					We had the same taste in drugs and women. I got blow from Richie for ten years,
					and my heroin. I’d go to Richie’s house and he would sell me a T—a tenth of a
					gram of heroin, a chunk, a rock—and it was <span class="italic">so</span> strong
					I could chop it in half and put it in a needle, it would just dissolve, and
					shoot it in my ass and then lick the spoon and I was <span class="italic"
						>gooood,</span> man, for four, five, six hours. I’d be strung out and
					shaking at four or five in the morning <span class="italic">so </span>many
					times. I’d call him and say, “Hey, man, I’m really sick.” I’d get in a cab—I had
					no money, so I’d just jump out of the cab and run, run into the entrance of his
					building, with the cabby yelling, “Hey, come back here!” I’d knock on his door
					and he’d always have something for me. He was so fucking great, Richie. He
					always had the good stuff.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Richie had girls, drugs, and a recording
					studio—everything I wanted in one place—so I would go to his apartment on First
					Avenue and Eightieth Street, hide from the world, and just get crazy. I’d go
					there, buy a hundred dollars worth of cocaine, and then snort five thousand
					dollars of it while I was at his house. We would stay up for days on end. Like
					many drug addicts, our dopey motto was “<span class="sc">BETTER LIVING THROUGH
						CHEMISTRY</span>.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">We were so blatant with drugs in this period. We
					thought we were invisible, but all the time there were those beady little eyes
					watching. Richie got a phone call one night that somebody in the band was about
					to get busted. “You need to clean your apartment,” the voice said and hung up. I
					don’t remember quite how the scenario went down, but we found out that this was
					coming from somewhere up in Boston. Still, it’s not good politics to bust rock
					’n’ roll stars. It wasn’t the thing to do. I mean, look at Keith Richards up in
					Montreal with pounds of heroin in a bath salts jar. I’ve been frisked years back
					where they actually put their hands on the package and let it go by, like, “Oh,
					well, no, <span class="italic">that’s</span> not it.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Richie and I were at the Coconut Grove Hotel in
					Florida one time. I was dope sick but I knew Richie had some stuff for me. He’d
					hidden the heroin in his underwear under his balls. I was jonesing, I was sick,
					and I got to the hotel. I banged on his door. <span class="italic">Thank god,
						he’s there,</span> I said to myself. “Richie, open the fuck up, I’m
					desperate.” He goes, “Wait a sec I gotta take a leak.” He went to take a piss,
					but he was so stoned that the thing fell in the toilet and as he flushed he saw
					the package go down the drain. And then we had to spend half the night going out
					to cop. But he knew people, so by four o’clock in the morning I got
					straight.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">If there was no freebase left I’d smoke just about
					anything—kitty litter, cottage cheese. Richie nicknamed me “Spider” because I
					would crawl on the floor looking for a piece of freebase that I thought I’d
					dropped but probably already smoked. I was always looking for things that
					weren’t there.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">And then the very drugs that made me ecstatic and
					godlike started to turn on me. I began looking for things—things that weren’t
					lost and people who weren’t there. Things invisible to the naked eyeball, but
					that <span class="italic">you know</span> are there. Looking, looking, looking
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Searching under the bed, examining under the door, looking out
					the windows—investigating. I was convinced I was under surveillance, believed I
					was being watched. By whom? By the IBI, of course, the Imaginary Bureau of
					Investigation, my relentless paranoia-induced pursuers.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">And the IBI was not all that I hallucinated. One
					time we were up two or three days in a row and Richie found me standing in the
					doorway with a mop and a pail.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“Where are you going?” he asked me.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“To wash my car,” I said.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“Give me the mop. Give me the pail.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“Oh, no, no, no! I gotta go clean my car.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“Steven, get real, we’re on the fifteenth floor of
					an apartment building in Manhattan.” I didn’t know where I was. Or care.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I was stoned out of my mind on drugs almost all the
					time. I moved out of my house in Sunapee and into Jack Douglas’s apartment in
					New York in the winter of 1982. Then I got an apartment in New York and started
					to work on the next album, <span class="italic">Rock in a Hard Place,</span>
					with Jimmy Crespo, Rick Dufay, Tom, and Joey. Our cocaine was written into the
					budget—as twenty-four-track reels of tape. Even if you were out on a yacht or an
					island somewhere recording on a mobile unit they’d fly drugs out to you in
					seaplanes.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I wrote the songs on <span class="italic">Rock in a
						Hard Place </span>with Rick Dufay and Jimmy Crespo. Two of these
					songs—“Prelude to Joanie” and<span class="italic">“</span>Joanie’s
						Butterfly<span class="italic">”—</span>are about a hallucinatory horse with
					wings and feathers. I bought some opium from a dealer named Reinhart, a tongue
					of opium, black and thick, about three inches long, half an inch wide, and half
					an inch thick. I didn’t smoke it; I’d roll it into balls and swallow it. I’d eat
					it and it was like, <span class="italic">fuck!</span> The best high on the
					planet is opium. I remember being so high one night, one of those nights when
					you can’t sleep, you’re in this wakeless, sleepless place, and a story came over
					me. I was in a barn, in a stall, there was a lot of hay, and this horse gave
					birth—with the waters of life pouring out of her. It was a beautiful white
					horse, and its baby was this kick-ass rocking horse—that’s what I called it—it
					had wings and feathers. I couldn’t figure it out. How would a horse have
					feathers? But that was the fantasy. I wrote two songs around this opium vision.
					“Prelude to Joanie” told the story .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">We put some freaky effects on <span class="italic"
						>Rock in a Hard Place.</span> I used a vocoder—essentially a frequency
					phaser or oscillator that had been used by Pink Floyd and Wendy Carlos. I was
					talking to one of the recording engineers and he said, “I can create this
					interesting audio hallucination if you’re interested.” “Oh, yeah?” I said.
					“Let’s do it.” He explained that it was a bizarre effect you can create using
					two stereo speakers in which a third sound appears to be coming from behind you.
					And I thought, <span class="italic">Wow, that is so cool.</span> So on “Prelude
					to Joanie” I hit an African drum with my elbow and it made this <span
						class="italic">oooouuum!</span> sound. You can hear it on the song really
					loud if you put your speakers in two corners of the room facing you. Suddenly
					you’ll hear a sound that appears to be coming from somewhere behind your head.
					People listening to the track would get up from the record in the middle of the
					song when they heard the drum beat and go to the door behind them to see who’d
					knocked. We could really fuck with people with this device. I got sold on it and
					bought it, but little did I know that it doesn’t work unless there’s music
					playing as well; that’s what throws the knock out of phase.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="sbdropcap"
					>B</span>rimstone, my heroin dealer, also had the best coke and weed. One day he
					brought over this girl he was dating—Lisa Barrick. She was gorgeous but so
					obviously not interested in me it kind of pissed me off, so I asked her, “Are
					there any more like you at home?” “Well, yeah,” she said, “I have an identical
					twin sister.” “Awright!” Her sister, Teresa, worked at a restaurant that served
					exotic dishes, like buffalo burgers. I had a hippopotamus steak the night I went
					there. We talked, and I told her how odd it was that I would ask Lisa this corny
					question and how it turned out she really did have an exact copy of herself at
					home. I was in love. We were making out in hallways and behind closed doors. I
					was still married to Cyrinda when I first met Teresa in 1978, but things between
					Cyrinda and me had already gotten worse and worse. The fights were
					horrendous.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Cyrinda could provoke me to violent reactions more
					than anybody I’ve ever known—with the possible exception of Joe Perry. Cyrinda
					wasn’t gay, but she’d adopted the grandiose gestures of a queen. “<span
						class="italic">Uhnk!</span> Oh, what are you FUCKIN’ tawkin’ abawt?! Oh,
					Jesus <span class="italic">Cher-ist!</span> You stupid fuck! Jesus! Get him the
					fuck outta heah! Oh, what a cunt! Oh, <span class="italic">Jay-</span>sus!” That
					kind of high-camp verbosity. <span class="italic">Huh-hoo-ahhh!</span> Cyrinda’s
					vicious put-downs were like getting slugged. I couldn’t take it after a while,
					because when I’m sober I get quiet. I think I’m such a fuckin’ bore.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="sbdropcap">O</span>ver a
					period of, say, twenty-five years I’ve gone to a bunch of different rehabs. I
					don’t remember the exactomongo timelines. So, to rehash—<span class="italic"
						>ha-ha-ha!</span>—all my rehabs (maybe we can crush one up and share it,
						<span class="italic">heh-heh</span>): (1) Good Samaritan Hospital in New
					York way back in ’83, then (2) Hazelden to (3) East House (and back to East
					House) to (4) Chit Chat in Wernersville, then (5) Sierra Tucson, then (6) Steps
					in Malibu in 1996 to (7) Las Encinas in 2008 with Erin, and (8) Betty Ford in
					2010. Whatever it takes.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">The first rehab I went to was back in ’83 because I
					was so fucked-up I was too wobbly to walk down the sidewalk. One of the reasons
					I wanted to go to Good Samaritan was that I’d heard they did tests on heroin
					there. <span class="italic">I’ll go!</span> I thought. “Well, can I be one of
					the guinea pigs for the heroin? What do we get, uh, a shot every day? I’ll do
					it!” NOT! That was Good Samaritan. Their motto came from the Bible: “T<span
						class="sc">HE </span>S<span class="sc">PIRIT OF THE </span>L<span class="sc"
						>ORD HATH SENT ME TO HEAL THE BROKENHEARTED AND RECOVER SIGHT TO THE
						BLIND</span>,” but as Saint Augustine said, “Please deliver me from my
					sinful life, O Lord—but not today.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">While I was on tour with the Jimmy Crespo–Rick
					Dufay version of Aerosmith in ’83, David Krebs had sent a psychiatrist, Dr.
					Lloyd Moglen, out on tour with the band to see what could be done, but—poor
					man!—he was aboard the ship of fools and their rabid pharmaceuticals. Lost
					souls! We were dazed and confused, divers in the murky depths of drugs and our
					din. We were down below the five-hundred-foot line—we couldn’t come up for air
					or we’d get the bends. The doctor threw up his hands: “There’s no saving them,”
					he cried. “The band is broken and cannot be fixed.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Cyrinda and I were in Florida around this time and
					I got into a vicious fistfight with her. She may have looked like Betty Boop but
					she could pack a punch like Sonny Liston.</p>
				<p class="x1song-first" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">Hey Betty Boop you got
						me droolin’</span></p>
				<p class="x1song-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">I’m buzzing round your
						hive tonight</span></p>
				<p class="x1song-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">You play the hooky stead
						of schoolin’</span></p>
				<p class="x1song-last" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">Son of a bitch put out
						the light</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">The fights with Cyrinda became so violent that
					David Krebs sent another psychiatrist to come get me. He brought me out to Saint
					Something’s Hospital in San Francisco. It was a mental institution. They put me
					on a gurney, wheeled me into a room. I was kicking like a mule, my feet were
					twitching. I’d been up for days, I needed sleep. I drank on the plane, but you
					can’t sleep on booze, you’ve got to pick it up and drink again after three
					hours. They put an IV in my arm. “Um, Doctor,” I pleaded, “I need some more
					Valium.” The fuck <span class="italic">promised</span> me he’d give me Valium.
					“All right, Steven, here it comes, look!” And I’d watch him hook up the tube.
					But it wasn’t Valium. They were dripping saline solution into my arm. Some
					junkies are <span class="italic">so</span> bad that they go shoot water into
					their veins because they want to shoot something. But I’m not that kind of
					junkie. I never liked to shoot heroin. I did it once in my vein. Mainly I shot
					it in my ass.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Cyrinda and I were really bad drug addicts. We
					spent <span class="italic">years</span> shooting cocaine. After that I went with
					Cyrinda down to Saint Martin, and we got into another <span class="italic"
						>raging</span> fight. We had bought all this blow from everybody before we
					left. The cops knew what was going on and they threw us <span class="italic">off
						the island </span>! We got deported from Saint Martin. You can imagine how
					outrageous you’d have to be to get deported from a Caribbean island for being
					rowdy. There were insane, uncontrollable fights; she’d hit me in the face and
					I’d slap her back. “You mean, Steven, you were <span class="italic"
						>hitting</span> a woman?” Oh god! Yeah!</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Cyrinda was driving away during this one horrific
					fight and I became so enraged I took my man bag and <span class="italic"
						>smashed</span> her windshield—I jumped up on the hood of the car and
					whacked it and it shattered into a hundred pieces. Cocaine in<span
						class="italic">sanity</span>! She got out of the car and came over and a
					violent, uncontrollable fight erupted. We were punching and scratching and we
					fell over and rolled on the ground. I yelled, “Stop! <span class="italic"
						>STOP!!!</span>” What was this fight about? What they were mostly all about:
					drugs. “Where’s the fuckin’ pills?” “I don’t know!” “What do you mean you don’t
					know? You had ’em last!” She came over and smacked me in the face with her bag
					and the bag fell open and all the pills fell out onto the floor. “They’re <span
						class="italic">in your bag,</span> you fucking cunt!” She was fucking
					hoarding them. “Okay, liar, give me the bag,” I screamed at her and ripped the
					bag out of her hand and in it were bottles and bottles and baggies full of
					pills. What kind of codependent fucking drug-addicted behavior is that? When I
					had drugs I’d always share—Cyrinda was more like Joe and Elyssa in that way.
					They would <span class="italic">have</span> pills or coke or heroin, but they
					wouldn’t part with one pill or one line of it even when I <span class="italic"
						>begged. </span>I would get dope sick and still have to get out there and
					sing. “You gotta give me a little something, man, I’ve got to go onstage
					tonight.” And I would have to go on and perform fucking strung out! Do you have
					any fucking idea what that’s like? I barely got through, barely made it to the
					end of the show. As bad as things got—and they got insanely ferocious—I never
					hated Cyrinda; I love her to this day. May she be in peace wherever she is. I
					loved her dearly, and when I went away for drug rehab, I wish she’d have come,
					too.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">The beginning of the end with Cyrinda came about in
					an odd way. I took Teresa and her sister, Lisa, to eat dinner at this restaurant
					called the Twins—it’s on the East Side, and only twins eat there. It’s a really
					funny scene. I’m in the middle of a tour, the band was cooking, and some guy
					spots me and goes, “Hey, Steven Tallarico!” And next thing I know it’s in the
					paper, Cyrinda hears about it, and wants to sue me for divorce, to serve papers.
					So that blew that night .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ruined everything. I guess she loved me,
					but she didn’t know how to do anything for herself. A love story could be
					written about how she loved me so much that it hurt her that we fought all the
					time and she became distraught. I’d like that to be the case, but that isn’t
					really our story. We fought in person, we fought on the phone, she’d yell at me,
					I’d yell at her—another song inspired, a couple years down the road, from <span
						class="italic">Done with Mirrors</span>, “The Reason a Dog”
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
				<p class="x1song-first" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">Yak yak yak</span></p>
				<p class="x1song-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">Lord, you give me the
						bends</span></p>
				<p class="x1song-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">Heads and
					tails</span></p>
				<p class="x1song-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">You’re all out of
						love</span></p>
				<p class="x1song-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">Like the reason a

				<p class="x1song-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">Has so many
						friends</span></p>
				<p class="x1song-last" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">He wags his tail
						instead of his tongue</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">It was “You know what? Well, fuck you! You better
					come up here and—” I’d say, “Cyrinda, you gotta calm down—” She was just a
					little too overbearing and over-the-top for me, not that I’m exactly a
					soft-spoken shrinking violet. We clashed, we fought like cats and dogs, and in
					the end, it just fell apart. I would tell her this on the phone: “Honey, I don’t
					think it’s going to work out, so let’s get a separation and see, okay?” And
					finally that’s what we did. She didn’t like that I was seeing Teresa—naturally.
					She was jealous and and and and and and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What more can I say that
					will make my side the truth and hers not?</p>
				<p class="x1bm-art-below" xml:lang="en-us">I was married to Cyrinda for twelve
					years. That’s a long time, although we probably only spent three and a half to
					four years physically together. I was living in New York .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Cyrinda
					stayed up in Sunapee. When she came to New York with Mia, I’d have Teresa hide
					behind the refrigerator and stuff like that. Things were very bad between us. I
					was trying to get sober; she was still getting high. Our divorce became final in
					September 1987. A year later Teresa and I got married.</p>

					and Ranger, as a puppy, fall 2009. (Chris O'Brien)</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">By then Elyssa was gone, too. Her parents put her
					in the loony bin. Joe’s new squeeze was Billie Paulette Montgomery—I introduced
					her to Teresa. They liked each other. Hey, this could work.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="sbdropcap">B</span>ut I’m
					getting ahead of myself. <span class="italic">Rock in a Hard Place</span> only
					made it to number 32 in the charts in the fall of ’82. For the first time in two
					years we went out on the road again, with Jimmy Crespo and Ricky Dufay, but it
					was a disaster and I ended up in rehab at Hazelden. Four fucking hellish nights
					of withdrawal. I knew what those fucks were up to. I called David Krebs: “Get me
					the fuck outta here. I’ve seen those movies. Fiendish scientific experiments!
					Spirit possession! Hypnotic trances! They’re exorcising my demons, the precious
					demons that brought me my power, my drugs, world-renowned narcissism. How do you
					expect me to write lyrics without demons? They have machines here to siphon off
					your creative juices and sell them to the Japanese!” I so desperately missed
					that drug high I would spin and spin until I got dizzy just to feel that
					narcosis starting to set in, to feel that tingling in my cerebellum. Five
					hundred dollars and a fast horse—that’s what I always need.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Not surprisingly, Hazelden didn’t work—I didn’t get
					it. It was years and a few more rehabs before I would get it. All I got was
					people experience. I’m a performer; I know how to work a room. While I was in
					Hazelden, Teresa came to visit me and brought me shooters from the plane. I
					snuck out and drank them all. It was the worst drinking bout I ever had. You
					could smell the liquor on my breath and I was ashamed to go to class. I didn’t
					get busted for it, but still I felt so mortified that I had disgraced
					myself.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">My god, by 1983 I had no money and no future except
					getting further into the pit. I felt I could hear the Voice of Doom saying, “I’m
					sorry, man, you’ve sung your aria.” I’d done everything I said I never would.
					Back in 1976, when I read stories about guys who lost everything and blew a
					million bucks snorting all they had, I used to say, “That’ll <span
						class="italic">never </span>happen to me.” But in the end I blew twenty
					million. I snorted my Porsche, I snorted my plane, I snorted my house in that
					din of drugs and booze and being lost.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">David Krebs told me I was broke and put me on
					twenty dollars a day, presumably to curb my drug intake. The way I got around
					that was to give the limo driver a two-hundred-dollar tip. He’d keep fifty and
					I’d get the rest to spend on my drug of choice, which increasingly was heroin. I
					was so out of it that when I got mugged—the guy stuck a pistol in my mouth—I
					didn’t care whether I lived or died. I was half dead anyway.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Eventually I moved into the Gorham Hotel with
					Teresa. Teresa would go down to Alphabet City—the East Village—daily and get me
					dope. Then I met one of our security guys, and he said, “What, are you crazy,
					man? You can get it right on Ninth Avenue.” I said, “Bullshit!” He goes, “Ninth
					Avenue. What’re you kiddin’? Ninth Avenue’s where you score smack. Everybody
					knows that!” I said, “Well, I don’t know it! Show me!” I got in his Corvette, he
					got me a bag, we drove back to the hotel, I dumped it out on the mirror, and it
					was a fucking pile! For twenty bucks? Twenty dollars’ worth of this stuff was
					more than you’d get in five bindles from downtown. A bindle was just a little
					bit, and you were lucky to get high off of two of them. It was too good to be
					true. I snorted the stuff from Ninth Avenue and went, <span class="italic"
						>Uhhh-gorrrrhhhh!</span> I spun right there. I got sick. It was fucking
					great shit! So for about a year, we got bags from there. Five, sometimes seven,
					mostly six, from the same guy. It came in a big white envelope. Forty weeks we
					lived at that hotel. We saved the envelopes, and when you ran out you could dump
					them out on the mirror, and when you scraped it all up you got a nice pile.
					Enough so that Teresa and I wouldn’t get dope sick. The brands of heroin all had
					these great fucking crazy names: Poison, Fat Boy, Hot Girl, General
					Westmoreland, Toilet.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="sbdropcap">I</span>
					remember in the midst of my din, hearing from fucking Alice Cooper that Joe was
					going to be his guitar player. I went, “<span class="italic">What?</span> You’ve
					got to be kidding!” My soul mate .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I was so fucking pissed that I
					called Joe up and asked him, “Are you joining Alice Cooper? Are you seriously
					going to fucking be his guitar player?” And he said, “Yeah,” like the prick he
					is! I said, “What the fuck? That’s the dumbest fucking thing I ever heard! Just
					stop. The shit’s over. Why don’t you just come back with Aerosmith? How could
					you go be with Alice Cooper? We’re Aerosmith. We have something so big THAT WE
					CREATED OURSELF! You’re gonna join a power that is already there .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
					be a little piece of it. Whereas YOU ARE the power in this band! We gotta get
					back together.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">On my children’s lives, that’s what happened. I
					called him .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he didn’t call me. This is not ego-speak. I hadn’t
					spoken to him for more than two years, but it felt like way longer. This wasn’t
					in <span class="italic">Walk This Way</span> and needs to be said. I’d push him,
					he’d scream at me .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we’d almost come to blows. Joe is
					passive-aggressive. He’d say heavy words, but say them quietly. You’re always
					hurt by the ones you love, right?</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Joe was really pissed off at David Krebs for
					holding him hostage. Supposedly Joe owed all this money, an
					eighty-four-thousand-dollar room service tab. Why was David charging Joe all
					that money? I know Joe couldn’t afford to pay it. Considering all the money he
					was making from us, don’t you think David at that point could have said, “What
					the hell. Fuck it!” He’s a ruthless guy. Then there was this other little matter
					with Leber-Krebs, who were both our managers and our accountants. Not that we
					weren’t fucked-up, fried, and filleted, but the whole business about Joe and me
					as the Toxic Twins, if you really did some digging you might find that it wasn’t
					all that coincidental that it started hitting the media right around the time
					Joe was getting ready to sue Krebs over those room service charges.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">The press loves catchy phrases and cute headlines
					and they latched right on to the Toxic Twins. When I fired Joe, the come shot
					was: “Band Breaks Up Over Spilt Milk!” Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-HA! Now all the
					journalists in the world get these little stars for being ASSHOLES! They’re not
					telling the truth ’cause they assume nobody wants to hear the truth! Headline:
					“Tyler on Drugs!” That should do the trick. The picture shows me holding a
					bottle of pills. Then in the second paragraph it says, “Those are the aspirins
					that he bought after he came out of rehab.” And you go back and you say, “Wait a
					minute! But it said ‘Tyler on Drugs!’ ” And then it clicks, “Ah! That’s how they
					got me to read it!” ’Cause if it said, “Tyler Safe,” no one would read it. I’d
					have to be an icon like Madonna to get a headline with my name and aspirin in
					the same headline. “Madonna Now on Aspirin.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">During the years that Joe and I were broken up I
					realized that I wasn’t half the musician I thought I was without him. But
					whatever was going to happen with Aerosmith, Joe would not deal with David Krebs
					again. Since we’d split up, Joe had met a manager named Tim Collins. I met him
					for the first time with Joe at a French restaurant in New York near Fifty-eighth
					Street. We had hamburger <span class="italic">à chevalle,</span> with an egg on
					it. Tim said, “Why don’t you just come to Boston?” “Nah, I don’t think so.”
					That’s when he said, “What if I gave you a gram a day?” And he did. That’s how
					he got us up to Boston, me and Teresa. He had his guy Monkey bring us over a
					gram at the hotel every morning at the Howard Johnson’s in Cambridge. He wanted
					to keep me there while he tried to put the band back together.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Tim played the game all managers play—he’d tell me
					Joe was interested in getting the band back together, that he’d really missed
					playing with Aerosmith, blah-blah-blah, and then he’d go back to Joe and tell
					him I wanted more than anything to reunite the band, that Joe was the essential
					element and without him, <span class="italic">da-di-da-da-da</span>—which was
					true, but it was all done through innuendo and manipulation. And that’s how Joe
					and I started to work together again.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Managers are predatory, they troll the stars—and we
					got trolled, used, and abused more than once. Not long after he’d got us, he was
					down at a club in New York, at a party, drunk out of his mind, bragging that
					he’s got Aerosmith, and this guy he was talking to said, “Aerosmith? Good luck!
					I used to book them. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You’ll never manage those guys, they’re too
					stoned. And by the way, the only thing that’ll get them outta that is AA.” And
					Tim went, “Huh? What the—?” But that stuck in his mind and it would resurface a
					few years later when the band was totally fucked-up again and he needed a way to
					pull us out of free fall.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I went to see the Joe Perry Project perform at the
					Bottom Line, then Joe came to the Worcester Centrum in the spring of 1983 to see
					an Aerosmith concert. We did a few lines of heroin in the dressing room—just for
					old times’ sake. “Joe, check this shit out, you’re not going to fucking believe
					it! See what you’ve been missing?” And then I fell down. I just got too high.
					That’s only happened three times in thirty years. So drunk or so stoned that
					everything was spinning so much I couldn’t stop it. This was at the height of my
					addictions and whatever the fuck. When you’re in that state, even when you lie
					down on your bed the room is still spinning around you. Anyway, we do a bunch of
					lines and I get onstage at the Centrum and I realize I’m lost. I can’t function
					at all, it’s like, “Oh, God, please help me!” Those few times when I got so
					fucking drunk or high that I couldn’t stand up we had to cancel that show.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I think it was the third song (it takes about
					fifteen minutes for whatever’s in you to really take hold) when I realized I was
					in serious trouble. “Oh, dear God, my God!” I stumbled over to the drum riser. I
					put my hand out, slipped, and missed it. It was totally fucked-up—a great way to
					reintroduce Joe to the band. But as Joe always says, it’s good to see a train
					wreck onstage—it means there’s something going on up there. Fallible fuckups,
					not the click-track machine flawlessly reproducing its iPod hits. But in my
					case, it was getting a little too close to a demolition derby.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">In early 1984 the band got back together at Tom’s
					house. That was great. The old machine was rollin’ ’n’ tumblin’ again—and
					stumbling and mumbling and falling down and disintegrating. For the first three
					years we were back together, everybody was so fucked-up! Eventually it reached
					critical mass and at that point Tim Collins recalled what the promoter had said
					to him when he first got the band: “It’s never going to work. These guys are
					alcoholics and drug addicts. Your only hope is AA.” It was time to get Aerosmith
					clean and sober. Not everybody in the band, of course. Since I was the
					Designated Fuckup I was the first one to get sent away. I wound up at East
					House, a rehab facility at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Masschusetts, in February
					of 1985. I put it in a song called “My Fist Your Face”:</p>

				<p class="x1song-last" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">Please, no
					more</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Naturally, I wasn’t exactly ready to give
					everything up on the spot, either. While I was in there, Teresa went to get me
					some blow from the only dealer she knew, a place in Queens. Now, as it happened,
					a friend of Tim Collins’s was there at the same time getting blow for Tim. Joe
					heard about it, called Teresa up, and said, “I’ll break your fucking legs if you
					give Steven any cocaine!” Meanwhile, Joe had gotten the okay from the Vatican
					master, Tim Collins, to carry on, drink, do whatever he wanted.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">They figured as long as they got <span
						class="italic">me </span>sober, the band would be fine. I had to be straight
					in order for Aerosmith to work. Gotta get Steven straight! So it was back into
					East House at McLean a second time in the fall that same year. At McClean I met
					a therapist named Bob Hearne and for the first time I began to think about
					another path to enlightenment other than drugs and booze. The problem is that
					rock ’n’ roll is a fantasy life and part of that fantasy is being high. Like
					most rock stars I suffer from Terminal Adolescence. I’ll never grow up. The
					animated twelve-year-old thing—without that you wouldn’t get up onstage in the
					first place. In rock you never have to grow up because you’re so insulated, you
					never have to deal with anything. Everything’s done for you .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
					you’re surrounded by staff and crew and managers and promoters and PR yentas.
					How do you rent a car, buy a plane ticket, reserve a hotel room? Oh, you’ve got
					to <span class="italic">call</span> them first?</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">In rehab they have all these theories: “No, no, no,
					Steven, don’t paint with your right hand! Paint with your nondominant hand!”
					“Why? Because I don’t know how to play with my left hand?” “Yes, that way you
					may come up with something that you don’t know was in there!” <span
						class="italic">Rrrrr-ight</span>.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">And even if I—through prayer, abstinence, and
					superhuman strength of character—were able to forswear the demons of dope and
					alcohol—what about my mates? Of course I’d call Tim from rehab from time to time
					and say, “Where’s Joe? When is Joe coming here?” “Oh, Joe’s down in the
					islands.” Tim let Joe go to an island, where he was drinking paregoric, that
					baby for the gums, and he’d dip a cigarette in it, smoke it, or drink the
					bottle, and you can get so stoned on a bottle of paregoric. Trouble with me, the
					Designated Patient, was that everyone else in the band and all the people around
					us were still using—massive amounts—so naturally, it didn’t take.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Tim’s theory of keeping the band straight on the
					road was farcical. Basically, Therapy 411 .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He would have his
					secretary dial information for AA meetings in the towns where we were playing.
					Dial tone. Start counting .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. one chimpanzee, two chimpanzee, three
					chimpanzee, four chimpanzee, five chimpanzee. CUE Lily Tomlin switchboard
					operator: “How-may-I-direct-your-call?” “Yes, L.A., downtown Los Angeles, AA,
					please? Thank you, I’ll wait.” Nasal Directory Assistance Operator’s voice: “The
					number is .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” I mean, that would take one minute, wouldn’t you say?
					Two? You dial the number for AA in L.A.: “Hello. What’s the address there? Do
					you have meetings? What days?” That was Tim Collins’s plan for keeping Aerosmith
					clean on tour.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Tim Collins found an apartment for Teresa and me in
					Beacon Hill, Boston, and another one for Joey. Then we moved from that apartment
					to a better one in Brookline. Teresa and I started going to a methadone clinic
					in Kenmore Square to try and get clean ourselves. This is fall 1986. I got down
					to five milligrams a day at the methadone clinic, because I didn’t like the way
					things were going. There was too much blow and too much heroin and I knew if I
					didn’t do something it was going to be The End. Who knows if I’d have made it on
					my own, but I was on my way down. No one told me to go to the methadone clinic.
					Teresa and I just did it. We were going to get married, we were going to have
					kids; we needed to change our lives.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">One day Tim called me and said, “There’s a
					conference call to Japan tomorrow morning, so you gotta be over early. Be at the
					office no later than seven <span class="sc">A.M</span>.” Drag myself out of bed,
					get down there, and what do I see but the entire band, on time (suspicious in
					itself), and all looking <span class="italic">very serious,</span> all sitting
					at a round table, and presiding over the round table is High Lord Doodle Dum
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the therapist Lou Cox. He singles me out and points his finger
					at me! What’d I do now? Or, let’s rephrase that: what’d I do that
					everyfuckingbody in this band hasn’t been doing up until this morning—and I’m
					not even sure about that. But they’re all looking fucking smug, because it’s
					Steven that’s to be burned at the stake. It’s pretty intimidating when your band
					members, your manager, and this self-important authority on mental health are
					sitting there in judgment, and I’m shaking and <span class="italic"
						>jonesing.</span> Your own band the firing squad! <span class="italic"
						>Aerosmith &amp; Wesson.</span> Big-shot doctor from New York tells me this
					is an intervention, which turns out to mean I have to listen to all the fucking
					complaints about my behavior from everybody in the band and <span class="italic"
						>I can’t speak</span>.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“Steven, just listen to the guys in the band; they
					want to address some of the issues of your behavior. Is that okay?” Fuck no! But
					what am I going to say? He starts going around the room, from Joey to Brad to
					Tom to Joe. It was all that “when you did that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I felt” shit.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“Steven,” Joe says somberly, “I felt betrayed when
					I was playing my guitar and you nodded out at the keyboard at rehearsal
					yesterday—”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“What are you talkin’ about? <span class="italic"
						>You</span> gave me the dope! We both did the same shit. We crushed up a
					Dilaudid and shared it—and you fell asleep right after me!”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Therapist: “No talking, Steven.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Next up is Tom: “When you yelled at me last week I
					could tell you were doing too much blow. I got really angry with you—”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">“What—</span>? The fucking
					blow came out of your sock, you fuck!”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“Uh-uh, Steven, you can’t speak.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Then Joey pipes up: “I got really upset when you
					started throwing stuff around at sound check the other day and I suspected you
					were doing blow.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“Joey,” I said, “why would you need to speculate
					about that? We both did a line right before that!”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“That’s what I mean, you’ve just become so blatant
					about it. Like when you did blow off my drums yesterday.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“What are you talkin’ about? You gave me
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it was your blow and <span class="italic">you </span>laid it out
					for me!”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“Steven, please! Let them talk.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Jesus, I’ve unknowingly slipped into Ratology 101!
					The study of “Why-is-the-rat-behaving-like-that?” First you shoot the rat up
					with adrenaline .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. then it runs into a wall and breaks its neck.
					Conclusion: that rat’s behavior was clearly deviant—we must do something about
					this!</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">The big-shot psychiatrist is getting theoretical!
					He’s got a thesis! He’s the authority (us lowly drug addicts know nothing). He’s
					doing this whole examination of behaviors, but no one’s allowed to know <span
						class="italic">why</span> the rat behaved like that. I go, “Excuse me,
					professor, do you think it had anything to do with shooting that rat up with
					adrenaline?” “Oh, no, no, no, it couldn’t be <span class="italic">that;</span>
					don’t you understand, it’s that rat’s <span class="italic">behaviors</span>
					we’re studying here.” Revive that rat and kill him again! That was me, I was the
					Experimental Rat, the deviant rodent whose behavior must be <span class="italic"
						>modified.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“Well, it’s a big band and we figured we’d have you
					go one at a time. We thought if Steven got sober, the rest of the group would
					also get clean.” How reasonable! How rational! But then they said, “Steven, if
					you don’t go away, we’re throwing you out of the band.” What?! You’re throwing
					me out of <span class="italic">my</span> band? I had to swallow that and suck it
					up.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Anyway, they allowed you to make one phone
					call—just like the cops—so I called Teresa and she said, “Don’t let them do it.”
					She goes, “They can’t do that to you! What are you talkin’ about? You did
					methadone. What do they want from you? I’m comin’ right over!” And just then, I
					thought, <span class="italic">You know what? I get it.</span> So off I went
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. away to the bins.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">But wait! You didn’t think I was going to slink
					away from this farce without a peep, did you? Let’s go into the Special Features
					of the Intervention Movie and listen to Steven’s commentary, shall we? I could
					have gone .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. “Okay, now I get to talk. Well, fuck you, fuck your
					therapist, I’m leaving. Find another lead singer, and by the way, before I leave
					I’d like to ask this High Doodle Dum therapist of yours a few questions: ‘Let me
					ask you, Dr. Cox, where’d you stay last night? You slept over at Tim’s house?
					You stayed the night before this meeting at the manager’s house?’ ” When I tell
					this to professional therapists they go, “What? That therapist stayed with the
					manager? Enmeshment! Wrong! Could have lost his license for that.” Ha-ha! Bye!
						<span class="italic">Ding-ding-ding-ding</span>.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">There’s your movie! Ooh, it would have gone a
					little differently. But I didn’t. I didn’t know how to say that back then. And,
					folks, that’s why I’m angry today! What would Spock have done here? How would
					Spock have dealt with this? Or any respectable drug counselor, like, say, Dr.
					Steve Chatoff? Oh, you know what he’d have said: “Excuse me, Joe, so you’re
					telling him you’re angry at him for falling asleep, but wasn’t it your
					Dilaudid?” “Well, yuh .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but I thought you said that we were to
					come here and this is about Steven.” “Well, you see, I can’t really point the
					finger at Steven if you gave him the drugs, so hold on here .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. are
					all you guys still using?” And the band in one noble, rousing cry would have
					said, “Hey, let’s all go to a rehab. Maybe we shouldn’t all go to the <span
						class="italic">same</span> rehab, but here’s what we should do
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we should all get clean.” Now, that could have happened and, by
					the way, would have worked. A good, strong mental health worker—who saw my point
					of view—would have insisted on that.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="sbdropcap">W</span>ell, I
					came back from rehab and I said, “You know what, you guys? Therapists at the
					rehab said I’m gonna use if I’m around you, so you guys, if you don’t get sober,
						<span class="italic">I’m</span> leavin’ and I’m gonna start another band and
					use the name.” I’d gone away to rehab, but none of the rest of the band did at
					that time. Brad never went. Joey never went. Tom never went. Joe carried on as
					usual. Tim Collins was afraid to come down too hard on Joe, and besides, he’d
					been in bed with Joe from Day One, because Joe and his girlfriends know how to
					makey-makey with the manager-manager. Tim Collins, because he’d become tight
					with Joe while Joe was broken up from Aerosmith, let him stay at his apartment,
					and Joe proceeded to empty his entire bar. Eventually Joe did go into rehab at
					Bournwood Hospital in Brookline, Massachusetts, after his son Tony was born in
					October of ’86.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Another notable fucked-up onstage incident happened
					in Springfield, Illinois, on the Back in the Saddle Tour in the late summer of
					1986 when partway through the show I just stopped singing and then sat on the
					edge of the stage and tried to tell jokes to the audience for about an hour
					until the show got canceled. It was the end of the line. Again.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I went into detox at Chit Chat in Wernersville,
					Pennsylvania—a fabulous rehab—in the fall of 1986. No mood-altering drugs to
					come down, they give you Clonidine. Cloni-fucking-dine lowers your blood
					pressure. You don’t want to move; you’re so lethargic that you’re never going to
					stroke out, which is a major concern with people coming off drugs.
					Benzos—Valium, Xanax, etc.—are the absolute worst to come off. I never even told
					anybody I was on benzos. I thought it was the heroin I was doing before I went
					in there. I’d got myself down to five milligrams at the methadone clinic in
					Boston, but I was still doing the benzos, massive amounts, snorting them,
					filling a Coke bottle full. I didn’t tell them what I’d been doing and I was
					tweaking out, but with the Clonidine I was chilled. They give you a patch of
					Clonidine. I was just <span class="italic">mrrr-vrree-mrrr, </span>in a hypnotic
					state. I couldn’t wake up, I couldn’t sleep, I had no energy, I would bang into
					the wall just trying to walk through a doorway. They also gave me Seroquel and
					Neurontin, which are nonnarcotic antipsychotic meds for people that are coming
					off drugs. I put a blanket on me and cocooned. There still was the Steven Tyler
					factor in there, but I didn’t care if the other patients stared at me. Fuck you!
					Fuck off!</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Coming out of that din with an absence of feelings
					and emotion, your periphery opens up more and more. They said, “No food in your
					room.” But of course I’ve got to break every rule. I brought an apple, a pear, a
					banana, and a peach and I put them by the side of my bed. Your smeller goes away
					when you’re doing hard drugs. The deeper, innermost things abandon you. How can
					you smell when you’ve got a snout full of drugs? When I noticed my sense of
					smell coming back, the musty, sweet aroma of the apple and the pear and the
					peach and the banana, it made me cry.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">While you’re going through detox, you’ve got to
					believe in something other than a pill craving and fuck me and fuck you and I’ve
					got to have it. You can knock the idea of some Higher Power, but you’ve got to
					believe in <span class="italic">something</span> or you’re just going to sink
					back into the muck. You’ve got to try and see things from a different place. I’m
					now thirty light years away from that person I was then, yet twelve years later
					I still had to get tweaked again.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Drug addiction, therapy, relapse .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
					going through the hell of detox. “God, please take this pain away, I’ll do
					fucking anything, God, please, no more!” I was in rehab with all the shit that
					entails, the great epiphanous moments. We’re back in the superior vena cava,
					heading to the heart. We’re heading to the ocean!</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Then one day in the hallway I saw this poster. It
					told the story of a man’s going through a nightmare journey and his epiphany at
					the end of it. I so identified with this story. I put myself in the guy’s shoes.
					He’s up on a mountaintop in a blizzard, snow and hell. He keeps on walking,
					pushing on grimly. He thinks he’s going to die and cries out to God to save him.
					Somehow he gets down from the mountain and finds himself at the beach. It’s warm
					and sunny, he’s walking along, thanking God for saving him, but when he looks
					down he sees there’s only one set of footsteps. He goes, “God, why have you
					forsaken me?” All of a sudden God appears and tells him, “I didn’t abandon you,
					those are my footprints. I’m <span class="italic">carrying </span>you!”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">When I read that I went to my room and fucking
					cried. We all need something to carry us: your mother carries you, falling in
					love, then rock ’n’ roll. Drugs did it for me for almost twenty years, got me
					the fucking candy store, didn’t it? My wives did it for me .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. so
					did my band.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="sbdropcap">E</span>nough
					about God (for the moment)—let’s talk about another religion we don’t understand
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Aerosmithism! Everybody cleaned up—for a couple of years, maybe
					three. Then certain people in the band started using again, but it wasn’t to the
					extent of the excesses of the past—it was often so low-key I didn’t even know
					they were doing it. All I know is I got twelve years out of it.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">And then in 1987 we made <span class="italic"
						>Permanent Vacation, </span>the best album we’d made in ten years—and the
					first one we ever did sober. It had “Rag Doll,” “Angel,” “Magic Touch,” and
					“Dude (Looks Like a Lady).” We knew we were back, opening it up with my “Heart’s
					Done Time”—my Trow-Rico Indian war cry and wailing inner-city sirens on top of
					two real killer whales, Highach and Finna singing, recorded at the Vancouver
					Aquarium. <span class="italic">Oh, yeaaah!</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">We were working on <span class="italic">Permanent
						Vacation</span> and I was talking to Toby Francis, our soundman at the time,
					about a sampler. You hit the button, and whatever goes into it gets sampled for
					a few seconds, then you can truncate it, manipulate it, and do whatever you want
					to it. Joe and I were all for it and decided to buy one. The next day Toby
					brought one in and tried to show us how to use it. I hit the “record” button,
					and Oh, my god, it’s recording! I blew a raspberry, Blllllllt-. Stopped and
					saved. I played the drums, it grabbed the snare, went into my keyboard
					.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. played a few notes, and it grabbed that, too.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Joe started riffing on his guitar and I grabbed
					another bit with the sampler by mistake. I hit “play” and it went “<span
						class="italic">she-mah-mat,</span>” and that was perfectly in time. I said,
					“Save that. That’s a great fuckin’ noise!” God is in the details.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I told Tobby to save the piece and make sure it
					didn’t get lost, maybe we could put it on the album somewhere. He did, we did,
					and the rest is history. For better or worse it sounds like “banana,” that
					little fun thing in the beginning of “Dude Looks Like a Lady.” I had Bruce
					Fairbairn assigned it hard left and right and glue it into the font of the song.
					It was super stereo ear candy and so beautiful when the band comes in full
					tilt.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I began carving out lyrics, “cruise,” “rused,”
					“floozed,” to fill in the blanks. I had a phrase. It started out as “cruising
					for the ladies.” Yeah right, as if .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I could never sing that in a
					song. I could take any scat, “here’s looking up your old address” and make it
					fit. Of course it works best if there’s something to hang my fuckin’ hat on,
					like a Joe Perry riff, some kind of a hook. I tried a few things and then, a
					moment went by .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I was sitting there with Joe and I came out with,
					“Dude looks like a lady.” Once I tapped into the insanity, the song wrote
					itself.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">That was the remembrance of the time the word <span
						class="italic">dude</span> first penetrated my brain. That dudeness came
					from the first time I heard that word used repetitatively, percussively. “Yo,
						<span class="italic">dude,</span> yeah, <span class="italic">dude,</span>
					yeah, <span class="italic">dude</span>!” I was friends with MÖtley Crüe. We were
					all staying at the Trump International in NYC and they wanted to go down to a
					club. I went, “Yeah, come on, let’s go!” We piled in the limo, and we had a
					blast. It was 1991, the year of the Dude. The “dude” thing was just starting to
					take off in NYC, like a virus. It was “<span class="italic">Dude!</span> He-ey,
					dude. <span class="italic">Duuuude.</span>” “Dude, man, you are the fuckin’
					shit!” “Dude, man, dude, I gotta tell you, dude, your clothes.” “I don’t have
					words for you, dude!” Everything was “dude” and I thought that is the funniest,
					motherfuckin’ thing! I couldn’t, you know, believe it. In my era, it was “cool”
					and “boss” and “groovy” and “let’s get down” and “let’s get it on.” “Dude” was
					really juvenile but very let’s drop in the half pipe and radical. I mean my
					mother at the age of sixteen wouldn’t have used such a jive expression.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Anyway, we went to the club, they got hammered—I
					didn’t—and that was that. A couple of months later, the dude thing was
					ingrained, imprinted on my brain.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I’d be writing songs with people and they’d say,
					“But that doesn’t rhyme.” But there are all kinds of rhymes; there’s soft
					rhymes, like “share” and “<span class="italic">Fair</span>port Convention.” Now,
					that rhymes. I would also try things like “All I want is a room somewhere / in a
					bra and my underwear.” That works, because there’s a picture being painted: the
					bra and my underwear jolts.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I’d written with the band and I’d written with
					Richie Supa, but Richie and I were best friends. Desmond Child was another
					matter altogether. He was a songwriter brought in by the record label. John
					Kalodner, the A&amp;R man from Geffen Records, loved the band, so he threw
					everybody he could at us. Desmond was from Cuba, so dapper and with a
					mustache—he’d been in Desmond, Child &amp; Rouge. And so began a long and
					involved songwriting career with other people.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">I loved writing with Desmond Child because we
					always got into arguments. When I first met him, I’d written all the lyrics to
					“Dude (Looks Like a Lady)”<span class="italic"> except</span> the first verse. I
					got kind of annoyed at myself for not finishing it. I could not find that first
					verse. I did not have an in. I said, “Hey, Desmond, I just don’t know how to get
					into this.” There were a couple of words here and there he threw in, but he got
					me into that first verse. He said, “Pull into a bar by the shore,” and I went,
					“Oh, god! Here we go!” I never started a song like that. And I said, “Well, now,
					I’ll give it a try, how about ‘Her picture graced the grime on the door.’ ” And
					he goes, “Oh, that’s great!” And “she was a long-lost love at first bite” rather
					than “sight.” And then he wanted me to sing, “I threw my money down on the stage
					/ and, well, I didn’t care.” “Are you serious, you want me to say <span
						class="italic">that </span>?” I didn’t want to say, “Oh, that’s too fey for
					me to say,” so I said, “Well, that doesn’t rhyme.”</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">“Dude looks like a—” why would you sing that? Do
					you know a transvestite? I’ve actually met quite a few. “Dude looks like a lady”
					means nothing OR it means SOMETHING. I go, all right, in a commercial world,
					it’s good, and not only is it good, but it gets under the hood of what everyone
					hides: the gay thing.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">When Desmond started throwing things at me that I
					didn’t know how to use, I should’ve said, “Nah! I can’t sing that.” But it took
					me a couple years before I could voice my objections that strongly. Just like
					when I got sober, I could not go into a bar and order a soda. The bartender
					would ask, “You want a beer? Can I get you a drink?” I couldn’t say, “I’ll take
					a ginger ale!” Could not say it. Because there was so much shame behind it—why
					would I be ordering a ginger ale? “Gimme a Jack on the Coke.” Now that was my
					natural mode of bar talk—I drank a bottle of Jack with my eggs! It was the
					norm.</p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="sbdropcap">A</span>t my
					first AA meeting, I looked around and felt right at home. I got in touch with
					whatever me had been there back then. I got to meet this fantastic woman who
					conducted guided imageries. The sessions took about an hour. And in that place
					you would learn to slither like a snake or—if you couldn’t swim—project yourself
					swimming across a lake, or saying good night to a child that died years ago. You
					sit there quietly and the therapists talk to you: “Okay, imagine the sun is
					going down, you smell the warm summer air. Where are you right now? You’re at
					your back door, you’re in a chair by your back door.” There’s a whole room full
					of people tuned in—guided imagery. “Here comes your dog, bend down and pet your
					dog.” And in your mind you’re petting your dog. Some of the guided images were
					so beautiful, so heart-rending, people would begin crying. “Picture your mom,
					can you hear her calling you for dinner.” After ten minutes of doing that with
					your eyes closed you are in a very vulnerable state.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">How sweet is that! Envision a cat that you loved so
					much, or get on a boat that once sank. Now you’re on the boat again, go out to
					your favorite fishing spot, you’re rowing. People would actually sway back and
					forth while envisioning the images. In their mind they were rowing. The
					therapist might talk to you about your first sexual experience, and you’d get an
					erection but the erection would be in your mind.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">How would you describe purple—grape juice maybe.
					What does black taste like? Licorice, I guess. I’m trying to think of a color
					that you can’t associate with something that tastes good. Orange—oranges. Yellow
					banana. How would you describe what pink tastes like? Pink .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
					pussy!</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">And that’s what I do with songs. I navigate through
					images.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Sometimes I feel like I’m so fucking boring in
					sobriety, but you’ve got to remember, when you take drugs you’re just spinning
					in your own head .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <span class="italic">so up in your own
						Kool-Aid,</span> you know? Up in da Kool-Aid, mon, but you do not know de
					fla-vah.</p>
