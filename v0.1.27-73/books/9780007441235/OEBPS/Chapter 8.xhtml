			<p class="x1bm-first" xml:lang='en-us'><span class="dropcap">W</span>ow, it’s funny, you look back now and the New York Dolls had that reputation for being over the top? Sure the Dolls were in the <span class="italic">way-out-o-sphere, </span>but we were in our own orbit. My mind was on the dark side of the moon, as Clapton said in his Bangladesh documentary. But back then everyone in the rock elite was livin’ on the edge and right out of Zap Comix, except for Zappa, who may have had one foot in the way-out-o-sphere, but the other was firmly planted up the ass of the Carl Sagan school of reality.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>I spoke to Frank once on the phone, having heard he was sober. Talk was he’d take out a whole floor of rooms for those on his crew who shared his passion. “What the fuck are you talking about, Steven?” he said. “I don’t have a problem with drugs; I’ve never <span class="italic">done</span> drugs!” “What?” I said flabbergasted. “But seriously,” I said, “you’ve never even smoked pot?” An emphatic <span class="italic">no</span> followed. Who would have ever thunk that the Mother of Invention had no intention of dancing with Leary, swapping spit with Kesey, or .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If Ever However I’m Hearing He Never .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. EVER .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. made sweet love to Don Juan, the Yaqui warrior of the peyote button tribe, then how the fuck did he ever write<span class="italic"> Over-Nite Sensation</span> or <span class="italic">Weasels Ripped My Flesh</span>? This was a wake-up call to a guy whose Alice B. Toklas imagination sprouted from the same soil as the trippin’ troubadours of the sixties. I thought he was one of <span class="italic">us</span>—the lost, the damned, the terminally unique ones. He was. He just didn’t <span class="italic">use</span>.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>But why was it so wrong for me to think that Zappa wrote such euphoric musical prose .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and that it wasn’t based on some euphoric narcotic substance that might have helped get him there? And even if he never took a drug (in the literal <span class="italic">snort, puff, </span>or<span class="italic"> swallow</span> sense)—he felt love. Love IS a drug (I knew that even before Bryan Ferry told me). Frank felt pain and anguish and sadness, and those are drugs of sorts. In fact, when you get scared out of your mind, your body releases drugs—endorphins and adrenaline—and just look at the molecular structure of adrenaline. It’s about four notches away from what cocaine’s made of. Endorphins—four notches from heroin.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>This was a new truth for me. Frank was only high on music. Is it Lao Tzu’s belief that it’s not the walls but the <span class="italic">space between the walls</span> that defines the room? WOW! Or my belief that it’s not the notes but the <span class="italic">space between the notes</span> that defines the song?</p>
			<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang='en-us'><span class="sbdropcap">I</span>n 1975, the year <span class="italic">Toys in the Attic</span> came out, we played with the Dolls at Max’s Kansas City. I knew something was going on when we were received at Max’s like Broadway Joe at the Super Bowl. There was so much magic in air, Lou Reed looked like Houdini. Aerosmith and the New York Dolls—it was the perfect marriage. David was <span class="italic">me </span>on steroids and nine-inch heels. The Dolls were OTT (over the top!). What I took from Johansen was his flamboyance and a wise mouth full of sass. But don’t gimme no lip .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I got enough of my own. I never wanted to wear lipstick onstage or high heels. Maybe I should have worn heels—my feet wouldn’t have gotten so fucked-up ’cause I couldn’t have moved around as much. I loved playing with the Dolls and the <span class="italic">wow</span> factor they possessed. The punch, the titles of their songs. But I thought that there were more toys in our attic. They would flame out magnificently while we were still setting a fire.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>When you’re a teenager, masturbation is more about doing it fast and not getting caught and less about doing it right and making it last. Later on, I’d cum to find out that the best thing about masturbation is that you didn’t have to look your best. The Dolls were wearing Glam to the Nines. That described the smoky din of Max’s on any given night. It was musical socialism: there was no formal headliner. The bathroom was full of blow, and the lineup of bands was whoever got their <span class="italic">line</span> first got to go onstage. Aerosmith, the Dolls, and Wayne County. And oh yeah, those fuckin’ chickpeas they put on every table. They were more of a weapon than an appetizer. Wayne would have a toilet onstage where he’d reach down and grab a handful of dog food from the bowl between his legs and rub it all over himself like he was smearing his body with shit. We only played for one thing back then, and we all played for the same reason. We came to fly our freak flags. I called it <span class="italic">Veni, vidi, vici, veni redux</span>. Latin for: “We came, we saw, we conquered—and we came again.”</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>I’d get so hammered when I hung with the Dolls. Johnny Thunders, who was one of the guitar players, used to go out with a twin named Lisa whose sister, Teresa, was very sweet. She and I dated long enough to eventually marry and have two beautiful children. Twins again. Ain’t it funny?</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>Johnny Thunders was so out there. His addictions took him to graffitiing the ceilings of his hotel bathrooms with his own blood. His girlfriend had stories about walking into hotel bathrooms and seeing his initials on the ceiling. I call that dancing with the devil. He’s died since, as have quite a few members of the band—they were hell-bent on self-destruction. Unlike the Dolls, we came up for air once in a while. At least early on.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>It took us a few more years to implode, but even then we kept on going. Music was our fuse, and drugs were the match. Like a Roman candle that would shoot out seven flaming stars, each one an album for us, we were used to living and surviving the cosmic sway. Drugs to me were like a black hole .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I was attracted to it and wasn’t afraid to have it take me to the other side.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>Around this time an unearthly creature came into my life. I first met Cyrinda Foxe when I was cruising the streets of the lower Village with David Johansen. She was gorgeous and glamorous, white hot (with a whisper of Norma Jean) with candy-floss blond hair. She was married to and consumed by David but devoured me with her eyes. I would sit there and watch her and wonder, “What the fuck is going on with these two?” This insatiable fox named Cyrinda was best friends with Joe’s wife, Elyssa, who knew exactly what was going on between us and invited her on tour with the band.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>While all this was going down, Cyrinda played lovely Lolita and we played cat and mouse for months on and off tour. She wouldn’t let me near her. You want it? Can’t have it! She was interested in my rock star catnip.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>As the fame got more chaotic, we needed to get more organized. We used to keep all our expensive equipment in our Mr. Natural truck and leave it out on the street, which wasn’t such a great idea. After a while, Ray found us a building for forty thousand dollars and we bought it to store our equipment, record in, and turn into Mission Control. Ray ran all the merchandise and mail order and fan club stuff out of there. It was in Waltham, Massachusetts, right next to Moe Blacks, and we called it the Wherehouse. Raymond was always thinking ahead, perhaps sometimes with the wrong head, but a head nonetheless.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>On Halloween, he put a party together for the grand opening of the Wherehouse and invited everybody who was anybody and anybody they knew. We set up the loading dock like a Moulin Rouge street scene. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. French maids waiting on tables in fishnet stockings, berets, and long black cigarette holders and an entourage that included a midget in a skunk suit claiming he was Pepe Le Pew, just to piss off the party crashers. Ray’s office, upstairs, was ground zero. In that room alone, we snorted half of Peru.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>The Wherehouse was so big you could park cars in it, which all of the band did. It was big enough to house a tractor trailer, which is exactly what we did. We brought in the Record Plant’s mobile unit, and that’s where we recorded <span class="italic">Rocks,</span> our fourth album.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>During the recording sessions, a guy from Columbia Records always had to be there. He wore a white jacket and was supposed to be like an engineer. The union forced us to have him there for the sessions. “Pandora’s Box,” from that album, is the one song I wrote with Joey Kramer. It was inspired by a friend’s house in Woodstock, New Hampshire. A river ran through the property with giant rocks on either side. The girls that hung out there would bronze their naked bodies on the boulders like a string of candied pearls. We’d always get to the water hole late, knowing they’d be posing like girls in a Vargas calendar. Now, you’re probably expecting some huge erotic revelation from me, but that’s not gonna happen. I will tell you this—if I had an extension cord long enough, I would have recorded the entire album right then and there, and in the heat of love, I would have screamed every vocal from the mounds of their Venus.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>Meanwhile, back at the garage, Joey’s strumming a guitar we found in a garbage can and starts playing this cool riff he’d gotten from the black soul bands he’d played with before Aerosmith. The riff was so inspiring, I wrote these lyrics .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
			<p class="x1song-first" xml:lang='en-us'><span class="italic">When I’m in heat and someone gets the notion</span></p>
			<p class="x1song-mid" xml:lang='en-us'><span class="italic">I jump to my feet and hoof it to the ocean</span></p>
			<p class="x1song-mid" xml:lang='en-us'><span class="italic">We find a place where no one gives a hoot</span></p>
			<p class="x1song-mid" xml:lang='en-us'><span class="italic">Nobody never ever wears a suit</span></p>
			<p class="x1song-mid" xml:lang='en-us'><span class="italic">The ladies there you know they look so proud</span></p>
			<p class="x1song-last" xml:lang='en-us'><span class="italic">That’s ’cause they know that they’re so well endowed.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>I nailed that verse in an hour. Joey, you’re the man.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>Then we went into “Nobody’s Fault.” This was one of the highlights of my creative career. If you listen really close to the front of “Nobody’s Fault,” there isn’t an intro to the song. I suggested to Joe that he turn his amp volume to 12 and the volume on his guitar off. Since the key of the song was an E, I suggested he start by fingering a D chord, and then turn the volume knob all the way up slowly. I told Brad to play an A chord, same dealio as Joe. Then Joe played a C, did the same thing—Brad played a G, Joe played a B-flat, Brad played an F, Joe played an A-flat, Brad played an E-flat, and then Joe and Brad both played a D chord. And when they played that D together, rolling the volume knob up with their pinkies—and holding it for a second—then the band came in on a crashing E chord like Hitler was at the door. I looked over and Jack Douglas was internally hemorrhaging with bliss.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>I was in the middle of the room with my headphones on (which we called “cans”) and a live mic in front of me, because I loved singing live vocals as the band tracked. It always seemed to incite a little riot inside of everyone. Right before the band came in on the downbeat, the union engineer from Columbia marked his presence for all time by opening the door right in the middle of that sweet silence. He had a clarinet in his hand that wound up on the front of “Pandora’s Box,” but that’s another story. You can actually hear the door opening in “Nobody’s Fault” to this day and it somehow seems to get louder and louder with each play, only ’cause you know it’s there now. Joe and I always loved to leave in spontaneous mistakes—that was our credo. Jack loved them, too.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>While you were making an album you’d find out things the Beatles had done on their records, sound effects and distortions, and how they got those effects by slamming a trunk or playing tracks backward. Jack and I were really into that. We put our amps in the hallway for “Train Kept a-Rollin’ ” and “Seasons of Wither” and stole the audience sound from <span class="italic">The Concert at Bangladesh</span> at Madison Square Garden.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>For “Back in the Saddle,” the first track on <span class="italic">Rocks,</span> I had a bunch of ideas. Jack and I thought of marching boots on a big-ass piece of plywood. I wanted to bring in the cowboy boots I used to wear with the buttons on the side from high school. We got the plywood and I was about to put the tambourine on my boots for that extra-added special effect when David Johansen appeared and proceeded to help me gaffer-tape the tambourine to my boots, and I became “Mr. Tambourine Man.” Thank you, Bob. David was cool, but I couldn’t help sitting there thinking, <span class="italic">God, your wife is as fine as wine!</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>You can hear the stomping after the verse .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
			<p class="x1song-first" xml:lang='en-us'><span class="italic">Riding into town by the light of the moon (stomp, stomp, stomp)</span></p>
			<p class="x1song-last" xml:lang='en-us'><span class="italic">Looking for ol’ Sukie Jones, she crazy horse saloon (stomp, stomp, stomp)</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>After those lines I would stomp with my feet on the plywood.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>In the prechorus you’ll hear “<span class="italic">I’m BACK in the saddle a-gai-ain</span>” with the sound of my tambourine boots on the plywood. Jack and engineer Jay Messina double-tracked it, then triple-tracked it so it sounded like an army marching .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
			<p class="x1song-first" xml:lang='en-us'><span class="italic">Peelin’ off my boots and chaps, I’m saddle sore</span></p>
			<p class="x1song-last" xml:lang='en-us'><span class="italic">Four bits gets you time in the racks, they scream for more</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>The next line went “<span class="italic">Fools gold out of their mines</span>.” I figured people would just think it was “Fools <span class="italic">go </span>out of their minds.” Then comes .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
			<p class="x1song-first" xml:lang='en-us'><span class="italic">The girls are soakin’ wet, no tongue’s drier than mine</span></p>
			<p class="x1song-last" xml:lang='en-us'><span class="italic">I’ll come when I get baaaaaaccckkkkkk .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>And then, if you listen really carefully after the next verse, you’ll hear a whip sound .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
			<p class="x1song-first" xml:lang='en-us'><span class="italic">I’m calling all the shots tonight, I’m like a loaded gun</span></p>
			<p class="x1song-mid" xml:lang='en-us'><span class="italic">Peelin’ off my boots and chaps, I’m saddle sore</span></p>
			<p class="x1song-last" xml:lang='en-us'><span class="italic">Four bits gets you time in the racks, I scream for more</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm-art-below" xml:lang='en-us'>The title of the song evoked riding a horse into the sunset, so I wanted the sound of a lariat and a whip. I set up two Neumann U80 mics and placed them twenty feet apart, got in the middle, grabbed a guitar cord, and said, “Turn on the mics,” whereupon I whipped the cord around my head letting it out—ten feet, eleven, twelve, thirteen .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. till it got out as close as it could to the mics without hitting them. So in the mix, Jack panned the whip from the left speaker to the right speaker. I’d call that ear candy.</p>

			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>At the end of the song, you hear the clomping sound of horses’ hooves galloping. I used two coconuts I stole off a mermaid’s chest. Actually, they were part of a percussion kit I got from SIR Studios. When we did “Sweet Emotion,” I asked for that same kit but they forgot the maracas. So if you listen to the front of “Sweet E,” you hear that <span class="italic">chicka, chicka, chicka</span>? That’s not maracas. Some guy at the studio left a packet of sugar on the console. I took the packet of sugar, held it up to the Neumann, Jack said, “Go ahead,” and I shook the sugar. And that’s the opening of “Sweet E.” That <span class="italic">was</span> sweet!</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>“Back in the Saddle” I hoped would be nostalgic, hearkening to the spirit of every Spaghetti Western I ever saw. The band played like the gods they were. Jack mixed it with Jay in the way you hear it today.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>I wrote “Rats in the Cellar” as a tip of the hat, or an answer to “Toys in the Attic.” Rat/cellar—toys/attic. Meanwhile, in real life, “Rats” was more like what was actually going on. Things were coming apart, sanity was scurrying south, caution was flung to the winds, and little by little chaos was permanently moving in.</p>
			<p class="x1song-first" xml:lang='en-us'><span class="italic">Goin’ under, rats in the cellar</span></p>

			<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang='en-us'><span class="sbdropcap">A</span>s time goes by, everything gets more chaotic: three shows in a row, one meet-and-greet (we called ’em “press the meat”) after another, every night, as the fun of it all came crashing in. It felt like the band was traveling a million miles a year, stopping at every galaxy, leaving our cosmic fingerprint and celestial scent as a little something for everyone to remember us by.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>The stadiums we played were getting bigger. Backstage setups became more elaborate. When we performed at the Cow Palace in San Francisco, there were pinball machines and ridiculously slammin’ naked mannequins that lined the hallways from the stage to our dressing rooms. You could only imagine how the wives loved that. In May ’76 we played to eighty thousand fans at the Pontiac Metropolitan Stadium in Pontiac, Michigan. The drugs were becoming more serious, too, and not just among the band and the crew. We rocked the Motor City for a little over ninety minutes. It seemed about one fan a minute got taken out of the stadium from an OD—Quaaludes and booze mostly.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>June 18, 1976. Mid-South Coliseum, Memphis, Tennessee—the infamous Memphis bust. I’m onstage, going, “Motherfuckin’ this and motherfuckin’ that,” my usual stage rap, but on this particular eve in this particular southern city, the cops didn’t like it one bit. Apparently there was a law against profanity. Who knew?! They told me to stop swearing or else. Or else <span class="italic">what</span>? Don’t they know that’s only going to <span class="italic">encourage</span> me? I was told, “If you cuss one more time. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” I said, “Like what?” And they said, “Well, <span class="italic">shit</span> and <span class="italic">fuck</span>.” And I said, “But <span class="italic">those are lyrics in </span>our songs!” The cop didn’t really like us a whole lot, so I said, “All right, I’ll do my best.” He goes, “Do your best? If you cuss, we’re throwing you in jail. And if you think we’re fucking with ya, try us out. We’ll <span class="italic">lock you up for a month. </span>We ain’t like the way they are up north!”</p>
			<p class="x1bm-art-below" xml:lang='en-us'>I couldn’t help myself, so I laid it down and said a few more choice words. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Our tour manager came up in between songs and said, “The cops are waiting for you. After the show, you’re gonna get arrested.” I was sufficiently drunk, to say the least. “Okay, no prob .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. tell ’em I’ll meet ’em in my dressing room.” And we went into “Mama Kin,” and before the song was over I told our tour manager to “Give me a blackout at the end of ‘Mama Kin.’ ” I waited for the right moment, and during the blackout I jumped off the front of the stage, ran all the way up the aisle and into the lobby, and they came from everywhere, four directions—here, there, and everywhere. Guns a-blazing .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. all to my head. Knocked me to the ground. “Boy, you’re under arrest! We gon fuck you up. You try to run, we’re gonna .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” I was frozen in my tracks and scared shitless.</p>
			<p class="art-2" xml:lang='en-us'><span class="generated-style-2"><img class="generated-style-2" src="images/35a_ST39_fmt.jpeg" alt="35a_ST39.jpg" /></span></p>
			<p class="captions" xml:lang='en-us'><span class="caption-drop-cap">H</span>ow we won the war by reaching out, 1976. (Ron Pownall for Aerosmith)</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>One of the white cops said, “You ain’t getting away with it like some of the niggers around here.” And I said, “How dare you fuckin’ say that! Don’t you know the word <span class="italic">nigger</span> was invented by white folks that <span class="italic">hate</span>?” Thrown to my stomach, foot on my neck, and with a gun to my head, he said, “Now you’re gettin’ double for saying the word <span class="italic">fuck</span>.” They grabbed me and threw me into the back of the car, and I wound up in a cold, dank cell for three hours. My lawyer called up and found out they set the bail for ten grand. Later, back at the hotel, smokin’ a bone, I thought to myself, <span class="italic">Sweet Jesus, I’ll never do that again,</span> then looked in the mirror, smiled, and said to myself, <span class="italic">Oh, yes I will.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>After my short-term incarceration, I got back to my room and as usual it was party central. We threw the girls out of the room and the TVs out the window into the pool. If you kept the extension cords on the TVs, when they hit the water they exploded like depth charges. We sent down our security guy to make sure there were no people in the pool who might get fried. No soup for the roadies that night.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>I don’t know if I can remember all the times I was arrested. There was a bust in Philly, there was a bust in Memphis, there was the time Joey and I were busted for setting off firecrackers at the Holiday Inn in Lincoln, Nebraska. And then there was the bust of Bebe Buell. She was a gorgeous model that caught my eye and ear at a club one night in New York City. Her reputation (like mine) preceded her. Mine being a rock star .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. hers, <span class="italic">dating </span>rock stars. And what a roster she had. The thought that I could make her Top 10 made my Dick Clark.</p>
			<p class="x1bm-art-below" xml:lang='en-us'>Bebe’s best friend, Liz Derringer (tuning-ax prodigy Rick’s wife), was chewing my ear off at Steve Paul’s Scene. Liz mentioned that Bebe didn’t have a composite sheet—that being an eight-by-ten glossy proof sheet of her beauty that would open doors and hopefully land her in the big time. Overhearing that, I wrote her out a check on the spot for three grand to cover the composite and with hopes a kiss would follow. Liz let us stay at her apartment on a double-sized pullout bed in her living room where we proceeded to cause the first New York blackout. But even that didn’t stop us from sucking the juice out of Manhattan. I had never been in that much love in my life. I didn’t know what to do with it all. But God did. She gave us a love child from heaven above, my beautiful Liv. We were on fire, and I got to tour Germany—with Bebe Buell on my arm.</p>

			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>I’d been on the exhausting flights to Europe many times before, but because I was with Bebe, I actually arrived before I took off. It was the shortest flight ever, in the sweetest kind of way. When we arrived, the press and the fans were so there, we had to get whisked to a back room to clear immigration. They searched Bebe as if she were Marlene Dietrich. I, on the other hand, a skinny-assed rock star, was the poster child for all orifice checking at every border. I had Bebe draw a W on each of my ass cheeks in red lipstick on the plane prior to landing so when they checked me and asked me to bend over, it would read “WOW” in any language. There I was, finally figuring out I had the power to communicate beyond my music.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>Unfortunately, Marlene and my WOW wound us both up in the interrogation room, surrounded by blue-eyed blondes wearing white rubber gloves. Unbeknownst to them, my hash coffin was stashed in my sock. The border cop said, “Vot eese dees?” I replied, “What the???” Raising his voice, he put it closer to my face. Again, “VOT EESE DEES?” And I fumbled back, “Whatinthewhatthe?” Then, even closer to my face, at which time .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I blew into the hash coffin as hard as I could, and the hash went flying everywhere! I was grabbed by my scrawny neck and handcuffed, and we wound up in a local slammer but were soon released for fear that we might apply for German citizenship .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and the promoter’s terror that the festival would break out in riots, because we were headlining—and you can’t headline without a lead singer, no matter what country you’re in.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>Bebe was with us when we saw Paul McCartney and Wings at the famous Hammersmith Odeon in London. Backstage, Paul and Linda are in this tiny dressing room. Bebe walks in and had some nickname for Linda. “Sluggo,” she says. “Sluggett,” fires back Mrs. Beatle. Then they fucking went at each other and started wrestling on the floor. When they finished their friendly skirmish, I went to the bathroom. I’m peeing when I look to my right and eight stalls down is Paul McCartney, who looks at me and goes, “I like your music, man.” I haven’t pissed right since!</p>
			<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang='en-us'><span class="sbdropcap">I</span>’d like to think it was because of my Cherubic Behavior that I landed on the cover of <span class="italic">Rolling Stone,</span> but I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. semimodestly digress. WE got on the August 24, 1976, cover of<span class="italic"> Rolling Stone</span> because Aerosmith had pulled Excalibur out of the stone. I was in a bungalow at the Chateau Marmont just below the Sunset Strip. Annie Leibovitz—bigger than big and soon to be bigger—showed up to shoot “moi.” If my daddy could see me now! Well, maybe not. It had to be five in the morning and I was out of dope. I’d had two hours of sleep from the night before. Annie promised that as soon as she got her shot .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I’d get <span class="italic">my</span> shot. I told Annie, “Look, we need to go out and cop some shit right now so I can get straight.” “Okay,” she said, “but look, just take your shirt off and lie down on the bed for a second. Just do this for me. It’ll take five minutes, come on, honey! And then we’ll go get it. I know someone that’s got some really good shit. They know Belushi and they’re right around the corner.” By now, I’m like Pavlov’s dog, salivating with a raging schooner. I leaned back on the bed and she got her shot .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. raw, razzled, and real. She was beyond good. Annie knew what she wanted and got it. And I didn’t. Nope .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. no dope for Stevie. I went home with my tail between my legs.</p>

			<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang='en-us'><span class="sbdropcap">N</span>ext stop, Japan .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Reminiscent of the sixties Beatlemania, we were welcomed with hysteria. As soon as we got off the plane, there were hundreds of screaming fans in the terminal, so many that we had to be lifted over their heads, like Cleopatra’s arrival at the bedside of Marc Antony. Their screams were almost deafening at the airport as at the Budokan where we played four sold-out shows in a row. If only management had had the foresight to tape those shows instead of rolling up dollars and getting laid on our dime, we might have beaten Cheap Trick to their Budokan punch. Which, by the way, was a great record. A live vinyl classic.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>We were terrified to get high in Japan, and drug desperation set in. Elyssa’s mantra was always “Let’s go shopping!” So Joe, Elyssa, and Henry Smith went out to see what was out there and ended up in an antiques store. In the window of the shop was an old clay pipe with a curved stem. Well, that looked promising, ancient drug paraphernalia, and Elyssa said, “I want that!” So Joe bought it for her and brought it back to the hotel. Joe handed it to Henry. “You do it first,” says Henry, because he didn’t know what might be in it. Joe turns the pipe upside down, lights a big bunch of matches all at once, and proceeds to inhale. Holy Edgar Allen POEpium! It <span class="italic">was </span>opium.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>He exhaled and the whole neighborhood got high. I even got a buzz and I was six floors above Joe!</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>Joe then slams the pipe on the table and, using his instinctive drug-user expertise, he digs out the black residue from inside the pipe. Like the fine artisan he is, he exhumes every smidgen to leave nary a trace of opi-yum in the ancient artifact. The room reeked from the unique, sweet smell of opium. They got a contact high from the countless lips that had kissed that pipe before. Within the hour, they were all projectile vomiting. “That’s some good shit,” Joe said. And they all pipe dreamed till dawn’s early light.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>The drug drought had been severe overseas—people’s eyeballs were squeaking, and if there was any white substance on the corner of anyone’s mouth it was left over from a week-old Dunkin Donut. It created maniac cravings for everyone; so on the way back we decided to stop in Hawaii and refresh ourselves. Kelly orchestrated with Krebs to accommodate the band’s so-called well-earned needs. We had somebody go to Boston to pick up a slope’s worth of snow and fly it to Hawaii, straight to the room we’d booked at the Holiday Inn. At the airport there was a mountain of bags from the Japanese tour. Somebody’s job was to stay and be on bag duty, but with bag drag and in a coke frenzy .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it was like, “Fuck the bags.” They made a beeline for the hotel, where Kelly took the mirror off the wall and put it on the bed. We laid out the ounce of blow and with an ace of spades playing card proceeded to chop out the names of everyone in the room. Ed got a weak bump. But Tulio Eppa Galucci can’t feel his nose to this day.</p>
			<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang='en-us'><span class="sbdropcap">I</span>n the spring of 1977 David Krebs had this bright idea that for our next record we should be insulated from the big, wicked city, away from temptation and drugs. Dream on! A geographical cure? Fuck me! Drugs can be imported, David .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we have our resources. Dealers <span class="italic">deliver</span>! Hiding us away in a three-hundred-room former convent was a prescription for total lunacy. Perhaps it was their <span class="italic">plan</span> to drive us crazy. Not a chance.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>Jack and the band designed every nuance for our own type of Deep Purple <span class="italic">Smoke on the Water</span> album experience. Rebuild a Studio A inside, out of the Record Plant mobile studio outside. Bring in the Grateful Dead’s culinary entourage—cooks at our beck and call (not that anyone was eating—sniff sniff) and dealers at every doorstep. It was called the Cenacle, an estate near Armonk, New York, and what got the band members into the idea was that it was pitched to us as a castle. But the only thing remotely resembling a medieval castle was the large fieldstone water tower. Other than that the Cenacle was just a big institutional building with lots of tiny rooms, covered in cobwebs, and probably haunted. What a fiendish plan.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>The Cenacle, a reference to the upper room where the Last Supper was held. Holy shit! I held court in my own mind up there. I was judge, jury, and instigator of all the lunacy that took place within the dysfunctional band family paradigm and the prayers left by the nuns unanswered. The silence was deafening, not even a face in a jar by the door. Just my own mind trying desperately to decipher the leftover realities of an abandoned nunnery. Quick—see if you can find some rhyme and reason to <span class="italic">that,</span> Steven.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>I fantasized about being Keith Richards in the south of France playing slide with a freshly broken-off bottleneck from a slammin’ vintage Lafite Rothschild that I’d just guzzled in homage to a vibe that I so fucking badly needed—to intimately feel like I was recording at Chopin’s mansion where Elton John birthed his classic <span class="italic">Honky Chateau</span>. I needed to get drunk on the placentic creative juices of my own musical imagination. A paradox of Creation—with delicious contradictions to create a fertile mind-set that I needed to embrace in order to occupy my own mental Cenacle and make this record real.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>A stoned-out rock star in his tattered satin rags lying on the ancient stone floor of a castle—slightly mad, but still capable of conjuring up a revolutionary album that would astound the ears of the ones who heard it and make the critics cringe. Still, that medieval fantasy must have seeped into my subconscious one enchanted evening when I wrote “Kings And Queens”.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>The Cenacle was Aerosmith at its most extreme in its high middle period—it was just over the top! We mentally and physically took the place over. Long before cellulars, we hard-wired phones in every room. We had a huge kitchen, a dining room, a place for the crew to sleep and work, and our massive Studio A along with smaller rooms for Jack to get sounds in. We ran a hundred feet of barbed wire to microphones in the chapel, where Joey’s drums were set up on the altar. And Jack Douglas exorcised Joey’s ass into the middle of next week working on drum parts to, of all things, a song called “Critical Mass.”</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>Some of us lived and breathed the Cenacle, and some of us simply went home at the end of the day. That never sat well with me. So if the recording day started at 4:00 <span class="sc">P.M.</span>, Joey wasn’t done till six in the morning anyway. To snort or not to snort? That wasn’t even a question. <span class="italic">Blow</span> and more blow to the point of <span class="italic">krell meltdown</span>. Joey achieved critical mass the night he hit a guardrail at 4:00 <span class="sc">A.M</span>. in his black 308 GTB Ferrari, foolishly passing up the blow we had offered him so he could stay awake. He was still totally burned, totally stoned, and when he totaled his car—by some miracle—he was all right.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>It was an incredibly creepy place .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. very poorly lit. There wasn’t much to whatever lighting was left in the place, so it was a lot of big dark living rooms and a lot of long hallways—a cavernous, grim place, especially at night. And then there were the little tiny rooms where the nuns had slept. I would walk into each room and go, “Rrrrrrright,” ’cause there was a bed, a chair, a window—and that’s it. Methinks frequent visits were made to one’s next-door cubicle. Fast and quickly in the wee hours of the morning, methinks. And the <span class="italic">freakquent</span> flier miles the sisters ran up .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. God only knows! If you marry divinity and deny your humanity, something’s gonna give. They were there before us and I waited patiently for divine intervention so I could tap into some of their sacred ether. And I thought to myself, <span class="hilite-things-that-come">THE THINGS THAT COME TO THOSE THAT WAIT MAY BE THE THINGS LEFT BY THOSE WHO GOT THEIRS FIRST.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>If you ever had to go get something in the kitchen in the middle of the night, it was a trip across the Sahara, never mind finding your way back. So we put little fridges in each guy’s room, but to go to the kitchen to get something, you had to go into this dark, dank basement. It was like the setting for a Roger Corman movie .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and then the vampires settled in. All in our minds, of course, but what an hors d’oeuvre for the main course to come.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>It’s always interesting the way other people—those outside our coven—see us in times of extremes. The cartoonist Al Hirschfeld came up while we were there and drew the caricature of the group that’s on the cover of <span class="italic">Draw the Line. </span>He really nailed us. We look like freakish botanical specimens pinned under glass. <span class="italic">Draw the Line</span>—it was the perfect title for the way we were living. I always went too far and was often reminded that I never knew where to draw the line. I hated to hear that, but that’s how it was. Say “Don’t do it,” and we would do it. ’Cause I knew that if you don’t know where to draw the line, then your choices become infinite.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>Joe had this lick he wrote on a six-string bass that was so definitive, the song just about wrote itself. It reached down my neck and grabbed the lyrics out of my throat. The way the band played that track was off the Richter scale as the energy of <span class="italic">that</span> song defined our very existence at that time.</p>

			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>All this and the Grateful Dead’s cooks in the kitchen! There were two or three girls crafting midnight munchies on the big old stove while growing pot in the basement. That’s all we knew about them—that they had cooked for the Dead. It wasn’t very good food .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and it was dosed. They’d put assorted drugs in our dinners. We never knew what was coming. One time they made pot brownies and Joey got so stoned he couldn’t record that night. We started buying our own food. Man must choose his poison .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. not be surprised by it in his soup.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>Every other day Henry would take my Porsche and go to Happy Town, New York City, or Westport, pick up an ounce of blow, drive back, split it up among the gang. And when our vials got to the bottom, everybody hit on Tom, ’cause he always had some stashed in his sock. The next day, it was, “Fuck, we need more.” One of the road crew would borrow a car, go back to Let’s Make a Deal, cop the shit, and come back to the Cenacle. Ground Hog Day kind of defined our lives, minus the alarm clock and Sonny and Cher. Every now and then we’d have a guy deliver. Room service personified. I’ll have a cheeseburger and a side o’ blow, please. He’d show up, we’d play him a track to wow him, snort a Buick, and send him on his way.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>We were all on different floors to keep each of our self-indulgent secrets to ourselves, wrapped in the shroud of “I need my privacy.” In the attic of the mansion, Joe had set up a shooting gallery, but this one was with guns. Joe had a single-action .22 rifle and I had the sister pistol, a Walther PPK 380; I’d given the brother gun to Keith Richards in New York in the guest bedroom of Freddie Sessler’s apartment on Keef’s thirty-sixth birthday .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. along with a giant gratuitous four-way horse tab of methadone.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>I would hide lines under ashtrays and various places in the room so nobody would find them. Rabbit and Henry Smith, our two trusted roadies, knew that Ray would sneak into my room and vacuum the floor with his schnoz. He could snort a jockey off a horse and suck the Formica off my kitchen table. So one day, after finding that even my bed had been Hoovered, I laid a line of Ajax on the kitchen sink under a doily left behind by one of the sisters. I was downstairs recording a vocal of “Draw the Line” when he screamed loud enough to be heard all the way back in Peru. We left it on the album, it was such a shriek; we comped it and mixed it into one of the guitar player’s feedback tracks. It was E to the Z .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. EW TWEEDLE-E-DEE.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>And then there was cocaine’s nasty stepsister—BOREDOM. In my more crazed phase at the Cenacle—in the space between my mind and where rumors lived—I began to secretly tape people who were saying shit about me behind my back. Fuck looking through the peephole of your apartment and seeing the CIA, aliens, and J. Edgar Hoover in drag (<span class="italic">HOLY SHIT, THEY’RE OUT THERE!</span>), they <span class="italic">were</span> talking about me. I had bought some wireless bugging devices in Japan with transmitters that had voice-activated microphones. I’d strategically strewn them everywhere and soon was listening to them talking about how <span class="italic">she’d </span>screamed the night before (instead of me on “Milk Cow Blues”). The crew called them Tokyo Spiders; they would find them all over the place—they were usually pretty obvious. I thought I was paranoid thinking they were talking about me. Just imagine how paranoid I felt when I <span class="italic">heard that story</span>. Well, it’s a he-said-she-said kinda story, because I never planted anything! And the only time I saw Tokyo Spider, she was blowing Ping-Pong balls out of her gynie in a strip club.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>Just how shattered we got lives in the tracks of “Bright Light Fright”.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>Best lyric Joe Perry ever wrote. It was the truth, it was clever, and it described us to a tee.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>We had a hard time making <span class="italic">Draw the Line</span> because of all the mountains of blow we had climbed with backpacks full of heroin and Tuinals. And when that becomes more important than the music, that’s when I should have drawn the line. I was up to four or five Tuinals a day, and David Johansen was bringing the Mexican black tar for Joe. It was all for one, one for all .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and me for myself. Everybody was waking up at different times. We were told to get to the studio at noon, but the band wouldn’t show up till seven or eight in the evening. Sometimes I wouldn’t get there until much later. I might show up at five in the morning and want to start recording just as Joe was leaving. For the crew it was a tag team—and someone always got the graveyard shift. That’s when I did my best vocals with Jack. There was no sense to me being there for Joe’s recording hours. He never wanted to record his tracks until I was finished with my vocals anyway. And they called my shit LSD! Talk about Lead Singer Disorder? Joe, knowing it would take me weeks to write the lyrics and sing the vocals, would use that time to get lost in Elyssa.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>Me? I did my fair share of Houdini. I would disappear into my Bela Lugosi boudoir, like Boris Karloff and the bride of Frankenstein. I wouldn’t come out until an angry mob arrived with pitchforks and burning torches. I didn’t realize until ten years later that it was Brad, Tom, and Joey. Days went by without anybody recording, or even playing. I was used to writing to riffs, but now there weren’t any riffs to write to.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>With <span class="italic">Draw the Line</span> we were trying to do the album we started at the Cenacle and tour at the same time. It took six months to do and cost half a million dollars. We’d go to, like, AIR Studios in London and do a session and then we’d go to Germany and do a concert. The crew would drive all night to a session at some other studio and we’d show up burned to a crisp in the wee wee hours of the yawn. “Hurry up and wait,” it seemed.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>All the big worms in the Big Apple came out to help us <span class="italic">Draw the Line</span> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. from Johnny Thunders to John Belushi to John Lennon. One night, looking for some rock in a hard place, Belushi and I went panning for gold after a twelve-hour session. We were so obsessed with copping that night, when the cab-driver asked Belushi, “Where ya headin’?” he answered simply (and loudly), “Cocaine!” I’d get in the cab with him and the drivers would say, “Hey, aren’t you—?” Belushi was beyond famous for being the Samurai guy on <span class="italic">Saturday Night Live.</span> But all we wanted to do was chop out lines with that sword.</p>

			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>The negativity and the drama sucked the creativity out of the marrow of my bones. I was down and Jack knew it. What drugs couldn’t fix, maybe a change of scenery would. “Come stay at my house and we’ll finish the album together.” Even that was like pulling teeth—when you don’t have any. When you’re that high, inspiration can be like standing in the middle of a rainbow, writing lyrics you never thought you could write, and blaming it all on the buzz. But then the day comes when you come to realize that even rainbows get the blues.</p>

			<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang='en-us'><span class="sbdropcap">S</span>o how could someone so broken not fall so in love with David Johansen’s main doll, Cyrinda? What a beautiful name, Cyrinda Foxe, and what a fox she was. I was on the chase for four months after we met in the Village in ’76. I was wounded and beaten from the band, the drugs, and the road, and in a hopeless romantic moment, I borrowed from Humphrey Bogart .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. “Are you guys getting along? Are you two really in love? Do you think you could fall for a guy that doesn’t wear lipstick? If I told you you had a beautiful body, would you hold it against me?” What a grouch I was. She looked at me and blushed. “David’s a different kind of guy. Heee’s <span class="symbols">&amp;#^^@^)@&amp;%@$!*&amp;</span>, and not only that, he’s <span class="symbols">#&amp;^#!%^&amp;</span> up. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” My “in” was that Cyrinda was really close with Elyssa and Joe. The triangulation between those three was like playing hockey in a sandbox, but once Elyssa invited Cyrinda on tour, I was on the road to <span class="italic">Casablanca</span>. Joe was against it, Elyssa was all for Cyrinda’s cock teasing.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>But she was a strange bird, that Cyrinda. She was a Warhol girl .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. had a part in his film <span class="italic">Bad</span>. She could Marilyn my Monroe one minute, and the next, Cruella my Deville. And then out of that love came the sweetest love of all, Mia. The rumor mill was cranking out bullshit in overdrive. She was on the cover of <span class="italic">Life,</span> and I loved her to Death. She worked for Warhol; I was an ass-hole. She was always too dramatic, and I was known as a drugged-out addict. The one thing they couldn’t write—and didn’t even think of—was what <span class="italic">we were,</span> and <span class="italic">that was</span> In Love.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>I knew that because we were both on fire was why the rumors kept burning. The “I’m going to take him for all he’s worth” type shit melted by the wayside. Cyrinda was trying to be the wisecracking, gum-chewing, Lolita-type blonde—but she wasn’t born yesterday. Sometimes a lost childhood can erode your innocence. By the time Cyrinda was twelve, she was already twenty-five. She could be bittersweet, wouldn’t let you get away with anything; sharp as a tack and ferociously to the point. <span class="italic">So</span> to the point, they called her “Syringa.” She told me that when she was thirteen, she’d walk along the beach in L.A. with needles stashed in her bobby socks and sell them to speed freaks.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>Where do you go from there? I know I’ve developed obsessions .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but I’m not obsessed. But I’m not obsessed. But I’m not obsessed. But I’m not obsessed. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I’m not sure whether I’m obsessive-compulsive, but I’m definitely obsessive-<span class="italic">im</span>pulsive<span class="italic">. </span>In courting Joan Jett while on tour with her, I would strip bare naked, put on a robe, pull the chair from near the elevator all the way over to the end of the hall, pushing it to right in front of her door. I’d then take my robe off and, sitting spread-eagled, ring the doorbell and wait for her to open it. She’d open the door and her jaw would hit the floor as I said, “I hate myself for loving you.” She gave me that look that I really wanted to see and responded in her best Mae West velvety growl, “I’m not into the big ten-inch, honey,” and slammed the door.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>But as all-consuming obsessions go, Cyrinda was my greatest. Why? you ask. ’Cause she was a good bad Catholic girl. And she laid it on heavy. God knows, I thought, I wanted it so bad, but she wouldn’t let me have it. “Don’t touch me there, God is watching.” Okay. “You can’t kiss me there, I’m still married. God is watching.” Okay. “Can I put my finger in your holy water?” Smack! I guess not. Now, you guys might not believe this, but God knows that we actually held out and waited to make love until her divorce with David was finalized. The waiting was beyond worth it .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and actually Divine. Because that was the night Mia was conceived.</p>
			<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang='en-us'><span class="sbdropcap">W</span>e were still working on <span class="italic">Draw the Line</span> when, in August of ’77, we went on tour to Germany. It was a Mudfest run by Mama Concerts. At Bilzen Jazz Festival in Belgium, the promoter showed up in a horse-drawn caravan, and as soon as the show began he took off, like the coachman in a Dracula movie. The backstage catering was roast pig. If you wanted cream in your coffee, they tied a goat to your table and said, “Milk away, <span class="italic">svinehunt</span>.” Eighty thousand people with mud up to their knees! We had to get the fire department to pull our bus out of the bogs. To make matters worse—after we were promised the world, our road crew wound up getting a stein of beer and a cold bratwurst. One of our crew guys climbed into the promoter’s trailer and took a shit on his desk. Leaving a little something for him to remember us by. It gave new meaning to the term .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Mudfest. Holy SOURbraten.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>To make matters bratwurst, I ran out of dope, and Joe conveniently said he didn’t have any. That’s an old story that goes deep with this band, and I know you can’t always get what you want, but you’d think .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. brother, I’m fronting your band, can’t you fucking front me some dope???</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>The Lorelei Festival was one of the worst gigs I’d ever done and almost put an end to the tour. Over there, it was our first introduction to a German audience, which in this case was half American servicemen. We went on at two o’clock in the morning. It’s on the banks of the Rhine—and it was cold, dark, dank, Eastern European kinda weather. The word <span class="italic">Lorelei </span>comes from the German river muse whose singing lured men to destruction—and <span class="italic">destroyed</span> just about described my voice after singing for two hours in the freezing cold rain. I started spitting up blood and damn near passed out onstage that night. Oh how I wished I had a roadie to change my strings and a fraulein to rub my gooseneck. I lost my voice, and we had to cancel our show in Sweden and go back to London. We were going to hell in a handbasket .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. without a handbasket.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>Sometimes, being on the long and winding road for what seemed like forever, we’d be in the middle of nowhere, in our rooms and out of our minds from the endless days and sleepless nights surrounded by girls with low tooth counts, missing <span class="italic">anything </span>American. So like the rock stars we were beginning to think we were, we’d bring the U.S. to us. Wherever we were, we’d send out for egg creams from a deli in New York to be flown to Czechoslovakia, but so much got lost in translation that when they arrived, they weren’t egg creams at all. It was like receiving a box of monkey nards dipped in tapioca from a country that hadn’t been discovered yet.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>At this point in our careers, we checked into hotels under pseudonyms. If you used your real name, you’d have a tribute band delivering your room service or a girl larger than your whole family trying to climb through your window. Mentioning the name Aerosmith brought nothing but pain and penicillin. But then what else do you give a band that’s got everything?</p>
			<p class="x1bm-art-below" xml:lang='en-us'>So we checked in under names like the Shakespearean Players, Upchuck and the Hurlers, or, my favorite, Six Legs and Four Balls (I stole that one from Peter, Paul and Mary). We’d arrive at the Holiday Inn and they’d say, “Welcome, Shakespearean Players!” We would say stuff like “Thank thee, sire” and “Will thou showest us-eth to our roometh?” (Try saying that with crackers in your mouth.) It was out there, but you know, at four in the morning, anything goes.</p>

			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>I’d lose more than my mind on the road—like, for instance, in Europe I once left the rock of Gibralter stashed in the curtain of the hotel we were staying in. I kept it there knowing that if we got busted, no one could pin it on me. Any hotel is transient. Could have been the guy from the night before. Don’t blame it on the American. Blame it on some wandering Gibralteronian.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>The band always stayed at their favorite bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel when we were in L.A. Mine was Bungalow 12 where I knew Marilyn Monroe had made sweet love to the likes of Arthur Miller, Joe DiMaggio, President Kennedy, and probably his little brother. I heard this from an off-duty officer who drove the doctor away the infamous night she passed. The hotel was a trampoline for the Who’s Who of Hollywood all the way down to the Tinseltown trashy. Sure, there were a few folks that got a decent night’s sleep at the reclusive retreat .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but it wasn’t me. On any given night the Polo Lounge could be a jumping-off spot for a movie deal, a drug deal, or a cop-a-feel deal. Bunaglow 12 was attached to another room that Joe and I booked as a suite. The only way you knew what bungalow we were in was by the caravan of room service trays lined up outside our door stacked with champagne, fifty-year-old brandy, and enough Beluga and Savruga caviar to embarrass the Great Gatsby.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>The place was always good for freakish and exotic sightings, like Michael Jackson having lunch with his chimp, Bubbles; or David Geffen with Cher skipping up the cobblestone path like Dorothy and the Scarecrow. Here I was, the big-time big-mouth rock ’n’ roll singer of Aerosmith, becoming speechless in the face of Lucille Ball, Joni Mitchell, and Lauren Bacall .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. all in the same night on the same path on the way to Bungalow 12.</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>We were the most decadent, lecherous, sexiest, nastiest band in the land, and yet from time to time I would wonder, <span class="italic">Where are all the beautiful women?</span> It finally dawned on me twenty years later, after road crews’ stories floated to the surface, that those clever fellows were “protecting” us from the hot chicks, blaming it on the wives of the only two guys that were married. “We couldn’t let them see her, Steven. But <span class="italic">here’s </span>a girl for you.” She, unfortunately, looked like Ernest Borgnine. Gee, thanks, fellas. With friends like that, who needs herpes? Brings us fittingly back to the first single from <span class="italic">Rocks,</span> “Last Child,” which I wrote with Brad Whitford.</p>

			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>It’s true that we were trying pretty hard not to get any on us and, even more important, that we’d make it home with lust in our eyes. This was the band’s rule: you didn’t have sex for ten days before the end of the tour. But the reason was so that you’d be sure to go home (sweet home) with a full cup of chowder. You could pull off the lusty eyes bit, but you could never get away with blowing a cup of wind.</p>
			<p class="x1bm-after-txb1" xml:lang='en-us'><span class="sbdropcap">J</span>une 21, 1977. Fort Wayne, Indiana. Two nights at the Coliseum with AC/DC. First night, I walked from my dressing room down a long hallway with handrails lined with wheelchairs. The second night, walking down that same hallway to a second slammin’ sold-out show, instead of fans in wheelchairs, there were a hundred fans handcuffed to the railing. Some were crying, some were screaming. I couldn’t believe my own eyes. It was like an Aerosmith concert gone police state. I screamed for Kelly. He told me that they’d all been busted for smoking pot an hour before Aerosmith took the stage. So the first thing I did after the opening number, I walked up to the mic and I said, “I just saw a hundred of your brothers and sisters handcuffed backstage and the cops are getting ready to haul their asses off to jail for getting high.” I started calling the cops “scumbags!” and “Gestapo!” It was fucked! The cops told me, “You do any funny business up there, we’ll throw your ass in jail, too, for inciting a riot!” And I go, “But, man, that’s <span class="italic">my job</span>!”</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang='en-us'>The crowd went fucking nuclear. “We’re not gonna let that happen.” They screamed even louder. “So here’s what we’re gonna do. We’re gonna pay for their bail. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Throw me a joint [it rained pot like a Cheech and Chong thunderstorm] and they’ll all be back here before the encore. I promise. We ain’t gonna let this happen. Not no more, no more!” As Joe played the intro and I sang .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
